(Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) do not apply to Recovery Act designated country manufactured
construction material. The restrictions of the Buy American statute do not apply to designated
country unmanufactured construction material. Consistent with U.S. obligations under international
agreements, this clause implements-
(i) Section 1605 of the Recovery Act by requiring, unless an exception applies, that
all manufactured construction material in the project is manufactured in the United States and, if
the construction material consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel, the iron or steel was produced
in the United States (produced in the United States means that all manufacturing processes of the iron
or steel must take place in the United States, except metallurgical processes involving refinement
of steel additives); and.
26
(ii) The Buy American statute by providing a preference for unmanufactured construction
material mined or produced in the United States over unmanufactured construction material mined or
produced in a nondesignated country.
(2) The Contractor shall use only domestic construction material, Recovery Act designated
country manufactured construction material, or designated country unmanufactured construction
material in performing this contract, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this clause.
(3) The requirement in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause does not apply to the construction
materials or components listed by the Government as follows:
[Contracting Officer to list applicable excepted materials or indicate "none".]
(4) The Contracting Officer may add other construction material to the list in paragraph (b)(3) of
this clause if the Government determines that-
(i) The cost of domestic construction material would be unreasonable;
(A) The cost of domestic manufactured construction material is unreasonable when the
cumulative cost of such material, when compared to the cost of comparable foreign manufactured
construction material, other than Recovery Act designated country construction material, will increase the
overall cost of the contract by more than 25 percent;
(B) The cost of domestic unmanufactured construction material is unreasonable when the
cost of such material exceeds the cost of comparable foreign unmanufactured construction material, other
than designated country construction material, by more than 20 percent;
(ii) The construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in
sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality; or
(iii) The application of the restriction of section 1605 of the Recovery Act to a
particular manufactured construction material would be inconsistent with the public interest or the
application of the Buy American statute to a particular unmanufactured construction material would be
impracticable or inconsistent with the public interest.
(c) Request for determination of inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy
American statute.
(1)
(i) Any Contractor request to use foreign construction material in accordance with paragraph
(b)(4) of this clause shall include adequate information for Government evaluation of the request,

a completed cost comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this clause.
(iii) The cost of construction material shall include all delivery costs to the construction site
and any applicable duty.
(iv) Any Contractor request for a determination submitted after contract award shall explain
why the Contractor could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could not have
requested the determination before contract award. If the Contractor does not submit a satisfactory
explanation, the Contracting Officer need not make a determination.
(2) If the Government determines after contract award that an exception to section 1605 of the
Recovery Act or the Buy American statute applies and the Contracting Officer and the Contractor
negotiate adequate consideration, the Contracting Officer will modify the contract to allow use of 
27
the foreign construction material. However, when the basis for the exception is the unreasonable cost of
a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is not less than the differential established in
paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this clause.
(3) Unless the Government determines that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act or
the Buy American statute applies, use of foreign construction material other than manufactured
construction material from a Recovery Act designated country or unmanufactured construction
material from a designated country is noncompliant with the applicable statute.
(d) Data. To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (c) of this clause based on unreasonable
cost, the Contractor shall include the following information and any applicable supporting data based on
the survey of suppliers:
Foreign (Nondesignated Country) and Domestic Construction Materials Cost Comparison
