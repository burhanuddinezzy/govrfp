Description:Description In support of the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), Fermi Forward Discovery Group (FFDG) Far Detector Cryostat (FDC) Team requires an air handling unit that is constructed of shipping splits. The temporary cryostat ventilation is required during the installation of cryostat membrane, insulation, and detector components. The system will feed conditioned air to the cryostat and circulate air using large feedthroughs in the roof of the cryostat. The air handling equipment will connect to the cryostat via non-conductive duct material to custom duct adapters as provided by FFDG. The air handling equipment shall be electrically connected in conduit to the designated power panel which are provided by the FFDG.
