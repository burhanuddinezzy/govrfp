PART IV - REPRESENTATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD 252.204-7024 NOTICE ON THE USE OF THE SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE RISK SYSTEM (MAR 2023) (a) Definitions. As used in this provisionItem risk means the probability that a product, based on intended use, will introduce performance risk resulting in safety issues, mission degradation, or monetary loss.
Price risk means a measure of whether a proposed price for a product or service is consistent with historical prices paid for that item or service.
Supplier risk means the probability that an award may subject the procurement to the risk of unsuccessful performance or to supply chain risk (see Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 239.7301).
(b) The Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS), available at https://piee.eb.mil/, will be used in the evaluation of the Quoter or Offeror's performance. SPRS retrieves item, price, quality, delivery, and contractor information on contracts from Government reporting systems in order to develop risk assessments.
(c) The Contracting Officer will consider SPRS risk assessments during the evaluation of quotations or offers received in response to this solicitation as follows: (1) Item risk will be considered to determine whether the procurement represents a high performance risk to the Government. (2) Price risk will be considered in determining if a proposed price is consistent with historical prices paid for a product or a service or otherwise creates a risk to the Government. (3) Supplier risk, including but not limited to quality and delivery, will be considered to assess the risk of unsuccessful performance and supply chain risk.
(d) SPRS risk assessments are generated daily. Quoters or Offerors are able to access their risk assessments by following the access instructions in the SPRS user's guide available at https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/ reference.htm. Quoters and Offerors are granted access to SPRS for their own risk assessment classifications only. SPRS reporting

N00104-25-Q-ZC91 PAGE 54 OF 55 252.204-7024 (CONT) NOTICE ON THE USE OF THE SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE RISK SYSTEM (MAR 2023) procedures and risk assessment methodology are detailed in the SPRS user's guide. The method to challenge a rating generated by SPRS is also provided in the user's guide. SPRS evaluation criteria are available at https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/ pdf/SPRS_DataEvaluationCriteria.pdf.
(e) The Contracting Officer may consider any other available and relevant information when evaluating a quotation or an offer. WSSTERMMZ01 EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD - SINGLE AWARD (NAVSUPWSS) The Government intends to make a single award to the eligible, responsible, technically acceptable offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is determined most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered. The offeror's proposal shall be in the form prescribed by, and shall be in the form prescribed by, and shall contain a response to each of the area identified in the Section L solicitation provision entitled "Submission of Quotations" or "Submission of Proposals." Only those proposals prepared in accordance with the solicitation will be evaluated. The evaluation will consider past performance as more important than price. The Government reserves the right to award the contract to other than the lowest priced offer. (1) Past Performance. The Government will evaluate the quality of the offeror's past performance. This evaluation is separate and distinct from the Contracting Officer's responsibility determination. The assessment of the offeror's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the solicitation.
The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for past performance. However, the quotation/proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote/proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the quotes/proposals of other offerors. The offeror must provide the information requested in the provision entitled "Submission of Quotations" or "Submission of Proposals" in Section L of the solicitation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly-related or similar past performance. An offeror failing to provide the past performance information or to assert that it has no relevant directly-related or similar past performance will be considered ineligible for award.
The Government, in addition to other information received, may utilize the DoD Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) program to evaluate past performance (refer to DFARS Case 2019-D009). The Government will consider SPRS data for theFederal Supply Classes (FSC) of all items included in this procurement. Based on comparisons among suppliers in a specific FSC group, SPRS sorts suppliers into color ratings representing the supplier's overall quality performance based on the following indices:
COLOR POSITION Dark Blue Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group Purple Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group Green Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group Yellow Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group Red Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group
(2) Price. Price is a secondary factor after past performance.
