solicitation. this provision and clause concern the imposition of a 2 percent federal excise tax withholding on any resultant contract award or payment request. this rule applies to federal government contracts for goods or services that are awarded to foreign persons - such as foreign contractors. it implements the department of the treasury's final regulations published in the federal register at 81 fr 55133 on august 18, 2016, under section 5000c of the internal revenue code relating to the 2 percent tax on payments made by the u.s. government to foreign persons pursuant to certain contracts. pursuant to the far 52.229-3 federal, state, and local taxes, taxes imposed under 26 u.s.c. 5000 c may not be included in the contract price or reimbursed. exemptions from this excise tax must be claimed by an offeror when it submits, with its offer, a u.s. department of treasury internal revenue service (irs) form w-14, certificate of foreign contracting party receiving federal procurement payments, available via the internet at www.irs. gov/w14. if not submitted with the offer, exemptions will not be applied to any resulting contract and the government will withhold a full 2 percent 00 21 13-2 on each contract payment. failure to submit an irs form w-14 with each payment request will also result in an automatic withholding of 2 percent from the payment request. when filling out the irs form w-14 the following information may be used to complete part i, lines 6 and 7. line 6 contract/reference number: w9127n26ba004 line 7 "name and address of the acquiring agency": usace portland district 333 sw first avenue portland, oregon 97204-3440 503-808-4616 any exemption claimed and self-certified is subject to audit by the irs. any disputes concerning this tax are adjudicated by the irs because the section 5000c tax is a tax matter not a contract issue. offerors are encouraged to seek guidance from their own tax professionals for advice concerning the provision, clause, and exclusions exclusion /submission of irs form w-14. additional information is also available at: notwithstanding the above, the usace does not have a means of withholding this excise tax at this time. as a result, contractors are expected to comply with the instructions above and to properly complete and return the w-14 at proposal submission, and with each pay application. the amount due for each withholding will be confirmed by usace, but will not be withheld. it is the contractor's responsibility to set aside, or remit to the irs, the amount confirmed by usace. whether the contractor sets the money aside for future payment to the irs, or makes payment to the irs, is the contractor's discretion, based on its analysis of the regulations regarding the excise tax. in the event that usace is able to withhold during contract performance, it will notify the contractor and make such a withholding (including any catch up withholdings); no advance notice is required to the contractor prior to the withholding. under no circumstances is usace liable for any tax not paid by the contractor. the contractor is liable for the tax, to the extent required by law, regardless of whether usace makes a withholding. far 29.204 expressly states that "[a]gencies merely withhold the tax (section 5000c tax) for the internal revenue service (irs). all substantive issues regarding the underlying section 5000c tax, e.g., the imposition of, and exemption from the tax, are matters under the jurisdiction of the irs." therefore, we cannot help you determine how the tax law applies to you. we strongly recommend that you contact the irs and/or a tax professional should you have any questions of this nature. to be clear, this information does not constitute tax advice or a representation of your tax liability. furnishing this information does not create liability for the usace for any federal, state, or local taxes applicable to the above-referenced contract or any other contract. *************************** for submission requirements and basis of evaluation: executed far provision 52.229-11. completed irs form w-14, certificate of foreign contracting party receiving federal procurement payments, if applicable. if not submitted with the offer, exemptions will not be applied to any resulting contract and the government will withhold a full 2 percent on each payment. notice to large business firms please see far clauses 52.219-8, "utilization of small business concerns (sep 2023)" and 52.219-9, "small business subcontracting plan (sep 2023)." large business concerns

express goals in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars and must be comparable to the dollar commitments in the small business participation plan, if applicable. definitions: subcontract means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies and/or services required for performance of the contract, contract modification, or subcontract. 00 21 13-3 small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria and size standards in far 19.102. such a concern is "not dominant in its field of operation" when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. floor is the term the u.s. army corps of engineers uses to replace goal. it represents the minimum level for small business performance. electronic subcontracting reporting system (esrs) means the government wide, electronic, web-based system for small business subcontracting program reporting. the esrs is located at http://www.esrs.gov. the following floors are considered reasonable and achievable during the performance of the contract resulting from this solicitation and are included for information purposes. final floors will be reviewed prior to contract award, and the subcontracting plan will then become a material part of the contract. a. 5% of the total subcontracted dollar value will be placed with all small business concerns. for the purpose of this subcontracting plan, small disadvantaged business (sdb), women-owned small business (wosb), hubzone small business, veteran-owned small business, and service disabled veteran-owned small business concerns are subsets of small business concerns. b. 1% of the total subcontracted contract dollar value will be placed with small disadvantaged business concerns or historically black colleges and universities or minority institutions. to be considered a small disadvantaged business concern, business must be certified by the small business administration in addition to meeting the definition under far clause 52.219-8(c)(3). c. 1% of the total subcontracted contract dollar value will be placed with small women-owned business concerns. women-owned business concerns may meet the definition of a small disadvantaged business. if so, it will also be considered a subset of a small disadvantaged business concern. d. 1% of the total subcontracted contract dollar value will be placed with hubzone small business concerns. to be considered a hubzone small business concern, business must be certified by the u.s. small business administration in addition to meeting the definition under far

service disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. floors included in any proposed plan should be at least equal to the recommended floors. if lesser floors are proposed, include an explanation for how those floors and the overall plan represent best efforts to comply with the policy outlined in the contract clauses. the proposed subcontracting plan must address how the offeror will maximize subcontracting opportunities within the small business communities of the project location. demonstrated outreach efforts through conference attendance, use of sam.gov, and corporate support of the small business program liaison officer and small business program must be addressed in the proposed subcontracting plan. subcontracting plans will be evaluated using appendix dd to the army federal acquisition regulation supplement (afars) 5119.705-4(d) to determine the offeror's ability to carry out the terms and conditions set forth in the contract clauses. if discussions during this review raise doubts regarding intentions or ability to comply with contractual obligations, it could result in disqualification for award. failure to receive a subcontracting plan rating of acceptable could jeopardize the offeror's selection for contract award. 00 21 13-4 section 00 22 00 - supplementary instructions in accordance with 52.102(c), the following provisions and clauses, available at www.acquisition.gov, require your review and action: 52.204-8 52.219-1 52.219-28 52.222-5 52.223-3 52.223-9 52.225-9 52.229-11 52.236-13alt. i 252.204-7007 252.236-7001 project labor agreement to be considered for award, all bidders must submit a project labor agreement (pla) as required for large-scale construction projects in accordance with far 22.503 and far clause 52.222-33. the government is not a party to the pla. per 52.222-33 subparagraph (b)(2), subcontractors are a party to the pla. however, it is not necessary for all subcontractors sign the pla, but they must agree to the terms of the pla negotiated by the prime contractor and labor organization. the prime contractor can meet the requirements of subparagraph (b)(2) by either: 1) inserting language into the subcontract requiring the subcontractor to acknowledge and abide by the terms of the pla; 2) having each subcontractor sign a letter of assent or an affidavit of pla participation. at a minimum, the proposed pla must address the requirements in far 22.504(b), which states a project labor agreement shall - (1) bind all contractors and subcontractors engaged in construction on the construction project to comply with the project labor agreement; (2) allow all contractors and subcontractors to compete for contracts and subcontracts without regard to whether they are otherwise parties to collective bargaining agreements; (3) contain guarantees against strikes, lockouts, and similar job disruptions; (4) set forth effective, prompt, and mutually binding procedures for resolving labor disputes arising during the term of the project labor agreement; (5) provide other mechanisms for labor-management cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern, including productivity, quality of work, safety, and health; and (6) include any additional requirements as the agency deems necessary to satisfy its needs. if the apparent low bidder does not submit an acceptable la, they may be ineligible for award and the contracting officer may move on the second low bidder. any pla reached does not change the terms of this contract or provide for any price adjustment by the government. 22.504 general requirements for project labor agreements. (a) general. project labor agreements established under this subpart shall fully conform to all statutes, regulations, and executive orders. (b) requirements. a project labor agreement shall- (1) bind all contractors and subcontractors engaged in construction on the construction project to comply with the project labor agreement; 00 22 00-1 (2) allow all contractors and subcontractors to compete for contracts and subcontracts without regard to whether they are otherwise parties to collective bargaining agreements; (3) contain guarantees against strikes, lockouts, and similar job disruptions; (4) set forth effective, prompt, and mutually binding procedures for resolving labor disputes arising during the term of the project labor agreement; (5) provide other mechanisms for labor-management cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern, including productivity, quality of work, safety, and health; and (6) include any additional requirements as the agency deems necessary to satisfy its needs. (c) labor organizations. an agency may not require contractors or subcontractors to enter into a project labor agreement with any particular labor organization. (d) exceptions to project labor agreement requirements-- (1) exception. the senior procurement executive may grant an exception from the requirements at 22.503(b), providing a specific written explanation of why at least one of the following conditions exists with respect to the particular contract: (i) requiring a project labor agreement on the project would not advance the federal government's interests in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement. the exception shall be based on one or more of the following factors: (a) the project is of short duration and lacks operational complexity. (b) the project will involve only one craft or trade. (c) the project will involve specialized construction work that is available from only a limited number of contractors or subcontractors. (d) the agency's need for the project is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that a project labor agreement would be impracticable. (ii) market research indicates that requiring a project labor agreement on the project would substantially reduce the number of potential offerors to such a degree that adequate competition at a fair and reasonable price could not be achieved. (see 10.002(b)(1) and 36.104). a likely reduction in the number of potential offerors is not, by itself, sufficient to except a contract from coverage under this authority unless it is coupled with the finding that the reduction would not allow for adequate competition at a fair and reasonable price. (iii) requiring a project labor agreement on the project would otherwise be inconsistent with federal statutes, regulations, executive orders, or presidential memoranda. (2) considerations. when determining whether the exception in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section applies, contracting officers shall consider current market conditions and the extent to which price fluctuations may be attributable to factors other than the requirement for a project labor agreement ( e. g., costs of labor or materials, supply chain costs). agencies may rely on price analysis conducted on recent competitive proposals for construction projects of a similar size and scope. (3) timing of the exception -- (i) contracts other than idiq contracts. the exception must be granted for a particular contract by the solicitation date. (ii) idiq contracts. an exception shall be granted prior to the solicitation date if the basis for the exception cited would apply to all orders. otherwise, exceptions shall be granted for each order by the time of the notice of the intent to place an order ( e.g., 16.505(b)(1)). far clauses incorporated by reference number title effective date alternate/ deviation variation effective date 52.217-4 evaluation of options exercised at time of contract award. jun 1988 00 22 00-2 section 00 45 00 - representations and certifications far clauses incorporated by reference number title effective date alternate/ deviation variation effective date 52.204-24 representation regarding certain telecommunications and video surveillance services or equipment. nov 2021 52.209-7 information regarding responsibility matters. oct 2018 52.209-13 violation of arms control treaties or agreements-certification. nov 2021 52.229-12 tax on certain foreign procurements. feb 2021 far clauses incorporated by full text 52.204-8 annual representations and certifications.

(b) definitions. "collateral costs," as used in this clause, means agency costs of operation, maintenance, logistic support, or government-furnished property. collateral savings, as used in this clause, means those measurable net reductions resulting from a vecp in the agency's overall projected collateral costs, exclusive of acquisition savings, whether or not the acquisition cost changes. contractor's development and implementation costs, as used in this clause, means those costs the contractor incurs on a vecp specifically in developing, testing, preparing, and submitting the vecp, as well as those costs the contractor incurs to make the contractual changes required by government acceptance of a vecp. government costs, as used in this clause, means those agency costs that result directly from developing and implementing the vecp, such as any net increases in the cost of testing, operations, maintenance, and logistic support. the term does not include the normal administrative costs of processing the vecp. instant contract savings, as used in this clause, means the estimated reduction in contractor cost of performance resulting from acceptance of the vecp, minus allowable contractor's development and implementation costs, including subcontractors' development and implementation costs (see paragraph (h) of this clause). value engineering change proposal (vecp) means a proposal that- (1) requires a change to this, the instant contract, to implement; and (2) results in reducing the contract price or estimated cost without impairing essential functions or characteristics; provided, that it does not involve a change- (i) in deliverable end item quantities only; or (ii) to the contract type only. (c) vecp preparation. as a minimum, the contractor shall include in each vecp the information described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (7) of this clause. if the proposed change is affected by contractually required configuration management or similar procedures, the instructions in those procedures relating to format, identification, and priority assignment shall govern vecp preparation. the vecp shall include the following: (1) a description of the difference between the existing contract requirement and that proposed, the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each, a justification when an item's function or characteristics are being altered, and the effect of the change on the end item's performance. (2) a list and analysis of the contract requirements that must be changed if the vecp is accepted, including any suggested specification revisions. (3) a separate, detailed cost estimate for (i) the affected portions of the existing contract requirement and (ii) the vecp. the cost reduction associated with the vecp shall take into account the contractor's allowable development and implementation costs, including any amount attributable to subcontracts under paragraph (h) of this clause. (4) a description and estimate of costs the government may incur in implementing the vecp, such as test and evaluation and operating and support costs. (5) a prediction of any effects the proposed change would have on collateral costs to the agency. (6) a statement of the time by which a contract modification accepting the vecp must be issued in order to achieve the maximum cost reduction, noting any effect on the contract completion time or delivery schedule. 00 72 00-13 (7) identification of any previous submissions of the vecp, including the dates submitted, the agencies and contract numbers involved, and previous government actions, if known. (d) submission. the contractor shall submit vecp's to the resident engineer at the worksite, with a copy to the contracting officer. (e) government action. (1) the contracting officer will notify the contractor of the status of the vecp within 45 calendar days after the contracting office receives it. if additional time is required, the contracting officer will notify the contractor within the 45-day period and provide the reason for the delay and the expected date of the decision. the government will process vecp's expeditiously; however, it will not be liable for any delay in acting upon a vecp. (2) if the vecp is not accepted, the contracting officer will notify the contractor in writing, explaining the reasons for rejection. the contractor may withdraw any vecp, in whole or in part, at any time before it is accepted by the government. the contracting officer may require that the contractor provide written notification before undertaking significant expenditures for vecp effort. (3) any vecp may be accepted, in whole or in part, by the contracting officer's award of a modification to this contract citing this clause. the contracting officer may accept the vecp, even though an agreement on price reduction has not been reached, by issuing the contractor a notice to proceed with the change. until a notice to proceed is issued or a contract modification applies a vecp to this contract, the contractor shall perform in accordance with the existing contract. the decision to accept or reject all or part of any vecp is a unilateral decision made solely at the discretion of the contracting officer. (f) sharing- (1) rates. the government's share of savings is determined by subtracting government costs from instant contract savings and multiplying the result by- (i) 45 percent for fixed-price contracts; or (ii) 75 percent for cost-reimbursement contracts. (2) payment. payment of any share due the contractor for use of a vecp on this contract shall be authorized by a modification to this contract to- (i) accept the vecp; (ii) reduce the contract price or estimated cost by the amount of instant contract savings; and (iii) provide the contractor's share of savings by adding the amount calculated to the contract price or fee. (g) collateral savings. if a vecp is accepted, the contracting officer will increase the instant contract amount by 20 percent of any projected collateral savings determined to be realized in a typical year of use after subtracting any government costs not previously offset. however, the contractor's share of collateral savings will not exceed the contract's firm-fixed-price or estimated cost, at the time the vecp is accepted, or $100,000, whichever is greater. the contracting officer is the sole determiner of the amount of collateral savings. (h) subcontracts. the contractor shall include an appropriate value engineering clause in any subcontract of $90,000 or more and may include one in subcontracts of lesser value. in computing any adjustment in this contract's price under paragraph (f) of this clause, the contractor's allowable development and implementation costs shall include any subcontractor's allowable development and implementation costs clearly resulting from a vecp accepted by the government under this contract, but shall exclude any value engineering incentive payments to a subcontractor. the contractor may choose any arrangement for subcontractor value engineering incentive payments; provided, that these payments shall not reduce the government's share of the savings resulting from the vecp. (i) data. the contractor may restrict the government's right to use any part of a vecp or the supporting data by marking the following legend on the affected parts: these data, furnished under the value engineering-construction clause of contract ____, shall not be disclosed outside the government or duplicated, used, or disclosed, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than to evaluate a value engineering change proposal submitted under the clause. this restriction does not limit the government's right to use information contained in these data if it has been obtained or is otherwise available from the contractor or from another source without limitations. if a vecp is accepted, the contractor hereby grants the government unlimited rights in the vecp and supporting data, except that, with respect to data qualifying and submitted as limited rights technical data, the government shall have the rights specified in the contract modification implementing the vecp and shall appropriately mark the data.

referenced. the publications are referred to within the text by the basic designation only. u.s. army corps of engineers (usace) er 1-1-11 (2017) administration -- project schedules 1.2 submittals government approval is required for submittals with a "g" designation; submittals not having a "g" designation are for information only. when used, a designation following the "g" designation identifies the office that will review the submittal for the government. submit the following in accordance with section 01 33 00, submittal procedures: sd-01 preconstruction submittals preliminary schedule; g eccc initial schedule; g eccc 1.3 quality control designate an authorized representative who must be responsible for the preparation of the schedule and all required updating (activity status) and preparation of reports. the authorized representative must be experienced in scheduling projects similar in nature and complexity to this project and must be experienced in the use of the scheduling software that meets the requirements of this specification. 1.4 general requirements a. prepare for approval a project schedule, as described herein, pursuant to far 52.236-15, schedules for construction contracts. show in the schedule the sequence in which the contractor proposes to perform the work and dates on which the contractor contemplates starting and completing all schedule activities. the scheduling of the entire project is required. scheduling of construction are the responsibility of the contractor. contractor management personnel must actively participate in its development. subcontractors and suppliers working on the project must also contribute in developing and maintaining an accurate project schedule. coordinate with other contractor's work at or near the site of the work under this contract in accordance with far 52.236-8, other contracts. b. the approved project schedule must be used to measure the progress of the work, to aid in evaluating time extensions, and to provide the section 01 32 01.00 25 page 3 msh sediment retention structure crest raise basis of all progress payments. 1.5 basis for payment and cost loading use the schedule as the basis for determining contract earnings during each update period and therefore the amount of each progress payment. lack of an approved schedule update, or qualified scheduling personnel, will result in the inability of the contracting officer (co) to evaluate contractor's progress for the purposes of payment. failure of the contractor to provide all required information will result in the disapproval of the preliminary, initial, and subsequent schedule updates. in the event schedule revisions have been directed by the co and those revisions have not been included in subsequent revisions or updates, the co may hold retainage up to the maximum allowed by contract, each payment period, until such revisions to the project schedule have been made. activity cost loading must be reasonable, as determined by the co. the aggregate value of all activities coded to a contract line item number (clin) must equal the value of the clin on the schedule. 1.6 software requirements the schedule must be compatible with primavera p6 professional v16.2. 1.6.1 critical path method use the critical path method (cpm) of network calculation to generate the project schedule. prepare the project schedule using the precedence diagram method (pdm). 1.6.2 milestones include milestone activities for each significant project event including but not limited to: notice to proceed (ntp), contractually required work windows, river diversion in place, foundation/substructure construction complete, superstructure construction complete, rcc construction complete, construction complete, and contract complete. 1.6.3 level of detail required include an appropriate level of detail in the project schedule. failure to develop or update the project schedule or provide data at the appropriate level of detail, as determined by the co, will result in its disapproval. the co will consider, but is not limited to, the following characteristics and requirements to determine the appropriate level of detail: 1.6.3.1 activity durations submissions must follow the direction of the co regarding reasonable activity durations. reasonable durations are those that allow the progress of activities to be accurately determined between payment periods. procurement activities are defined herein. less than two percent of all non-procurement activities must have original durations (od) greater than 20 work days or 30 calendar days. 1.6.3.2 procurement activities include activities associated with the submittal, approval, procurement, fabrication and delivery of long lead materials, equipment, fabricated assemblies, and supplies. long lead materials and equipment are those section 01 32 01.00 25 page 4 msh sediment retention structure crest raise materials that have a procurement cycle of over 90 calendar days. a typical procurement sequence includes the string of activities: submit, approve, procure, fabricate, and deliver. 1.6.3.3 critical activities the following must be included and properly scheduled: a. critical path activities. b. activities that fall within one week of critical path activities. c. mix design activities, mob/calibration of batch plant and placement of rcc completion prior to the end of iww window. d. submission and approval of record (as-built) drawings. e. submission and approval of all required testing. f. contractor's punch-out inspection. g. correction of punchlist from contractor's punch-out inspection. h. government's pre-final inspection. i. correction of punch list from government's pre-final inspection. j. final acceptance inspection. 1.6.3.4 government activities government and other agency activities that could impact progress must be shown. these activities include, but are not limited to: submittal reviews, approvals, environmental permit approvals, inspections, lockout/tagout procedures, utility tie-in, government-furnished equipment (gfe), and ntp for phasing requirements. 1.6.3.5 responsibility identify all activities in the project schedule by the party responsible to perform the work. responsibility includes, but is not limited to: the subcontractor, the prime contractor, or government agency performing a given task. the responsible party for each activity must be identified by the responsibility code. activities must not have more than one responsibility code. 1.6.3.6 work areas identify all activities in the project schedule by the work area in which the activity occurs. activities must not be allowed to cover more than one work area. define work areas based on resource constraints or space constraints that would preclude a resource, such as a particular trade or craft work crew, from working in more than one work area at a time due to restraints on resources or space. the work area of each activity must be identified by the work area code and activities must not have more than one work area code. section 01 32 01.00 25 page 5 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 1.6.3.7 contract line item number (clin) code all activities to the clin on the contract line item schedule to which the activity belongs. clin item code all activities, even when an activity is not cost loaded. an activity must not contain more than one clin item code. 1.6.3.8 phase of work identify all activities in the project schedule by the phase of work in which the activity occurs. code construction phases proposed by the contractor to allow filtering and organizing the schedule by construction packages. activities must not contain work in more than one phase of work. each activity must be identified with a single project phase and have only one phase of work code. 1.6.3.9 category of work assign a category of work code to all activities based upon the category of work to which the activity belongs. category of work refers, but is not limited, to the procurement chain of activities including such items as construction submittals, approvals, procurement, fabrication, delivery, weather sensitive installation, non-weather sensitive installation, start-up, and testing. assign a category of work code to each activity. each activity must have only one category of work code. 1.6.3.10 definable features of work assign a definable feature of work code to appropriate activities based on the definable feature of work to which the activity belongs. definable feature of work is defined in specification section 01 45 00.00 25, quality control. an activity must not have more than one definable feature of work code. not all activities are required to be definable feature of work coded. 1.6.3.11 modification or claim number assign an activity code to any activity or sequence of activities added to the schedule as a result of a contract modification, when approved by the co. any activity that is added or changed by contract modification or used to justify claimed time must be identified by a mod or claim number that changed the activity. activities must not belong to more than one modification or claim item. approval to add these activities does not necessarily mean the government accepts responsibility and, therefore, liability for such activities and any associated impacts to the schedule, but rather the government recognizes such activities are appropriately added to the schedule for the purposes of maintaining a realistic and meaningful schedule. such activities must not be responsibility coded to the government unless approved. existing activities must not normally be changed to reflect modifications. 1.6.4 scheduled project completion and activity calendars the schedule interval must extend from ntp date to the required final physical completion and contract end dates. the contract completion activity (end project) must finish based on the required contract duration in the accepted contract proposal, as adjusted for any approved contract time extensions. the first scheduled work period must be the day after ntp is received by the contractor. schedule activities on a calendar to which section 01 32 01.00 25 page 6 msh sediment retention structure crest raise the activity logically belongs. activities may be assigned to a seven day calendar when the contract assigns calendar day durations for the activity such as a government acceptance activity. if the contractor intends to perform physical work less than seven days per week, schedule the associated activities on a calendar with non-work periods identified including weekends and holidays. assign the category of work code - weather sensitive installation to those activities that are weather sensitive. original durations must account for anticipated normal adverse weather. the government will interpret all work periods not identified as non-work periods on each calendar as meaning the contractor intends to perform work during those periods. 1.6.4.1 project start date start the schedule no earlier than the date on which the ntp was acknowledged. include as the first activity in the project schedule an activity called "start project". the "start project" activity must have an early start "es" constraint date, equal to the date that the ntp was acknowledged, and a zero day duration. 1.6.4.2 constraint of last activity completion of the last physical activity in the schedule must be constrained by final construction physical completion date. submission and acceptance of the last transmittal in the schedule must be constrained by the contract end date. schedule calculations must result in a negative float when the calculated early finish date of the last activity is later than the contract end date. include as the last activity in the project schedule an activity called "end project". the "end project" activity must have a late finish "lf" constraint date equal to the contract end date for the project, and a zero day duration or by using the "project must finish by" date in the scheduling software. the schedule must have no constrained dates other than those specified in the contract. there must only be two open ended activities: start project (or ntp) with no predecessor logic and end project with no successor logic. 1.6.4.3 early project completion in the event the project schedule shows completion of the project prior to the final construction physical completion or contract end date, identify those activities that it intends to accelerate or those activities that are scheduled in parallel to support the contractor's "early" completion. specifically address each of the activities noted in the narrative report at every project schedule update period to assist the co in evaluating the contractor's ability to actually complete prior to the contract period. the last activity must have a late finish constraint equal to the contract end date and the schedule must calculate positive float. the government will not approve an early completion schedule with zero float on the longest path. the government is under no obligation to accelerate activities for which it is responsible to support a proposed early contract completion. 1.6.5 interim completion dates contractually specified interim construction completion dates must be constrained to show negative float if the early finish date of the last activity in that phase falls after the interim construction completion date. section 01 32 01.00 25 page 7 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 1.6.5.1 start phase include as the first activity for a project phase an activity called "start phase x" where "x" refers to the phase of work. the "start phase x" activity must have an "es" constraint date equal to the date on which the ntp was acknowledged, and a zero day duration. 1.6.5.2 end phase include as the last activity in a project phase an activity called "end phase x" where "x" refers to the phase of work. the "end phase x" activity must have an "lf" constraint date equal to the date on which the ntp was acknowledged, and a zero day duration. 1.6.5.3 phase "x" hammock include a hammock type activity for each project phase called "phase x" where "x" refers to the phase of work. the "phase x" activity must be logically tied to the earliest and latest activities in the phase. 1.6.6 default progress data disallowed actual start and finish dates must not be automatically updated by default mechanisms that may be included in the scheduling software systems. actual start (as) and actual finish (af) dates assigned during the updating process must match those dates provided from contractor quality control reports. failure of the contractor to document the as and af dates on the daily quality control report for every in-progress or completed activity, and failure to ensure that the data contained on the daily quality control reports is the sole basis for schedule updating must result in the disapproval of the contractor's schedule and the inability of the co to evaluate contractor progress for payment purposes. updating of the percent complete and the remaining duration of any activity must be independent functions. program features which calculate one of these parameters from the other must be disabled. 1.6.7 out-of-sequence progress activities that have progressed before all preceding logic has been satisfied (out-of-sequence progress) will be allowed only on a case-by-case basis subject to approval by the co. propose logic corrections to eliminate all out of sequence progress or justify not changing the sequencing for approval prior to submitting an updated project schedule. correct out of sequence progress that continues for more than two update cycles by logic revision, as approved by the co. 1.6.8 negative lags and start to finish relationships lag durations contained in the project schedule must not have a negative value. do not use start to finish (sf) relationships. 1.6.9 calculation mode schedule calculations must retain the logic between predecessors and successors even when the successor activity starts and the predecessor activity has not finished. software features that in effect sever the tie between predecessor and successor activities when the successor has started and the predecessor logic is not satisfied ("progress override") will not be allowed. section 01 32 01.00 25 page 8 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 1.7 submissions provide the submissions as described below. the data, reports, and network diagrams required for each submission must be in accordance with paragraph entitled submission requirements. 1.7.1 preliminary schedule submit the preliminary schedule, defining the contractor's planned operations for the first 90 calendar days, for approval within 15 calendar days after the ntp is acknowledged. the approved preliminary schedule must be used for payment purposes not to exceed 90 calendar days after ntp. completely cost load the preliminary schedule to balance the contract award clins shown on the price schedule. detail it for the first 90 calendar days after ntp. it may be summary in nature for the remaining performance period. it must be early start and late finish constrained and logically tied as previously specified. the preliminary schedule forms the basis for the initial schedule specified herein and must include all of the required submissions and approvals identified in the contract (for example, quality control plan, safety plan, and environmental protection plan), other construction, and non-construction activities intended to occur within the first 90 calendar days after ntp. 1.7.2 initial schedule a. submit the initial schedule for approval within 30 calendar days after ntp. provide a reasonable and realistic sequence of activities which represent all work through the entire contract performance period. the initial schedule must be at a reasonable level of detail as determined by the co. b. periodic schedule updates - based on the result of progress meetings, specified in paragraph entitled periodic progress meetings, submit periodic schedule updates. these submissions will enable the co to assess contractor's progress. if the contractor fails or refuses to furnish the information and project schedule data, which in the judgment of the co is necessary for verifying the contractor's progress, the contractor must be deemed not to have provided an estimate upon which progress payment may be made. 1.7.3 standard activity coding dictionary use the activity coding

schedule, and every periodic schedule update throughout the life of the project: 1.8.1 data submission provide the project schedule via email or file transfer site as required by the cor. name files indicating the type of schedule: (preliminary, initial, or update), contract number, and data date. 1.8.2 narrative report provide a narrative report with the preliminary, initial, and each update of the project schedule, as the basis of the contractor's progress payment request. include: a description of activities along the two most critical paths, a description of current and anticipated problem areas or delaying factors and their impact, and an explanation of corrective actions taken or required to be taken. the narrative report is expected to communicate to the government the contractor's thorough analysis of the schedule output and its plans to compensate for any problems, either current or potential, which are revealed through that analysis. identify and explain why any activities that, based on their calculated late dates, should have either started or finished during the update period, but did not. 1.8.3 approved changes verification include only those project schedule changes in the schedule submission that have been previously approved by the co. specifically reference, on an activity by activity basis, all changes made since the previous period and relate each change to documented, approved schedule changes. 1.8.4 schedule reports the format for each activity for the schedule reports listed below must contain: activity numbers, activity description, original duration, remaining duration, early start date, early finish date, late start date, late finish date, total float, actual start date, actual finish date, and section 01 32 01.00 25 page 10 msh sediment retention structure crest raise percent complete. the following lists typical reports that will be requested, of which one or more may be requested for each schedule submission: 1.8.4.1 activity report a list of all activities sorted according to activity number. 1.8.4.2 logic report a list of detailed preceding and succeeding activities for every activity in ascending order by activity number. 1.8.4.3 total float report a list of all incomplete activities sorted in ascending order of total float. list activities which have the same amount of total float in ascending order of early start dates. do not show completed activities on this report. 1.8.4.4 earnings report by clin a compilation of the contractor's total earnings on the project from the ntp to the data date. this report must reflect the earnings of specific activities based on the agreements made in the field and approved between the contractor and co at the most recent monthly progress meeting. provided that the contractor has provided a complete schedule update, this report must serve as the basis of determining contractor progress payments. group activities by clin and sorted by activity numbers. this report must: sum all activities coded to a particular clin and provide a clin item percent earned value, and complete and sum all clin items to provide a total project percent complete. printed report must contain, for each activity: the activity number, activity description, original budgeted amount, total quantity, quantity to date, percent complete (based on cost), and earnings to date. 1.8.5 gantt chart the gantt chart is required for the preliminary, initial, and periodic updates. depict and display the order and interdependence of activities and the sequence in which the work is to be accomplished. the co will use, but is not limited to, the following conditions to review compliance with this paragraph: 1.8.5.1 continuous flow diagrams must show a continuous flow from left to right with no arrows from right to left. show the activity number, description, duration, and estimated earned value on the diagram. 1.8.5.2 project milestone dates show dates on the diagram for start of project, any contract required interim completion dates, and final construction physical completion and contract end dates. 1.8.5.3 critical path clearly show the two critical paths. section 01 32 01.00 25 page 11 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 1.8.5.4 banding organize activities as directed to assist in the understanding of the activity sequence. typically, this flow will group activities by category of work, work area, and responsibility. 1.8.5.5 s-curves show earnings curves for projected early and late earnings and earnings to date. 1.9 periodic progress meetings progress meetings to discuss payment must include a monthly onsite meeting or other regular intervals as determined by co. during this meeting describe, on an activity by activity basis, all proposed revisions and adjustments to the project schedule required to reflect the current status of the project. the co will approve activity progress, proposed revisions, and adjustments as appropriate. the contractor's project manager and authorized scheduler must attend the meeting with the co. 1.9.1 update submission following progress meeting if required by the co, submit a schedule update, not later than four working days after the monthly progress meeting. include a complete update of the project schedule containing all approved progress, revisions, and adjustments, based on the regular progress meeting, reflecting only those changes made during the previous update meeting. 1.9.2 status of activities update information, including actual start (as) dates, actual finish (af) dates, remaining durations (rd), and percent complete will be subject to the approval of the co. as a minimum, address the following items on an activity by activity basis during each progress meeting: 1.9.2.1 start and finish dates accurately show the status of the actual start (as) and actual finish (af) dates for each activity currently in-progress or completed since the last update. only assign as dates when actual progress occurs on an activity. 1.9.2.2 remaining duration update the estimated remaining duration for each activity in-progress. base time-based progress calculations on remaining duration for each activity. 1.9.2.3 cost completion update the earnings for each activity started. payment will be based on earnings for each in-progress or completed activity. payment for individual activities will not be made for work that contains quality defects. a portion of the overall project amount may be retained based on delays of activities. section 01 32 01.00 25 page 12 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 1.9.2.4 percent complete update the percent complete for each activity started based on the realistic assessment of earned value. activities which are complete except for remaining minor punch list work and which do not restrain the initiation of successor activities may be declared 100 percent complete. 1.9.2.5 logic changes specifically identify and discuss all logic changes pertaining to ntp on change orders, change orders to be incorporated into the schedule, contractor proposed changes in work sequence, corrections to schedule logic for out-of-sequence progress, lag durations, and other changes that have been made pursuant to contract provisions. the government will only approve logic revisions for the purpose of keeping the schedule valid in terms of its usefulness in calculating a realistic completion date, correcting erroneous logic ties, and accurately sequencing the work. 1.9.2.6 other changes other changes required due to delays in completion of any activity or group of activities include: a. delays beyond the contractor's control, such as strikes and unusual weather. b. delays encountered due to submittals, government activities, deliveries, or work stoppages which make re-planning the work necessary. c. changes required to correct a schedule which does not represent the actual or planned prosecution and progress of the work. 1.10 requests for time extensions in the event the contractor believes it is entitled to an extension of the contract performance period, final construction physical completion date, contract end date, or any interim milestone date, furnish the following for a determination by the co: justification, project schedule data, and supporting evidence as the co may deem necessary. submission of proof of excusable delay, based on revised activity logic, duration, and costs (updated to the specific date that the delay occurred) is obligatory to any approvals by the government. in response to each request for proposal issued by the government, submit a schedule impact analysis demonstrating whether or not the change contemplated by the government impacts the critical path. 1.10.1 justification of delay the project schedule must clearly display that the contractor has used, in full, all the float time available for the work involved with this request. the co's determination as to the number of allowable days of contract extension must be based upon the project schedule updates in effect for the time period in question, and other factual information. actual delays that are found to be caused by the contractor's own actions, which result in a calculated schedule delay, will not be a cause for a time extension to the performance period, final construction physical completion date, contract end date, or any interim milestone date. section 01 32 01.00 25 page 13 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 1.10.2 extension submission requirements a. submit a justification for each request for a change in the final construction physical completion and contract end dates of less than two weeks based upon the most recent schedule update at the time of the ntp or constructive direction issued for the change. such a request must be in accordance with the requirements of other appropriate contract clauses and must include, as a minimum: (1) a list of affected activities, with their associated project schedule activity number. (2) a brief explanation of the causes of the change. (3) an analysis of the overall impact of the changes proposed. (4) a sub-network of the affected area. b. identify activities impacted by a unique activity code contained in the required data file. 1.10.3 additional submission requirements for any requested time extension of over two weeks, the co may request an interim update with revised activities for a specific change request. provide this within four days of the co's request. 1.11 directed changes if the ntp is issued for changes prior to settlement of price and time, submit proposed schedule revisions within seven calendar days of the ntp being issued. the proposed revisions to the schedule will be approved by the government prior to inclusion of those changes within the project schedule. if the contractor fails to submit the proposed revisions, the co may furnish the contractor with suggested revisions to the project schedule. include these revisions in the project schedule until revisions are submitted and final changes and impacts have been negotiated. if the contractor has any objections to the revisions furnished by the co, advise the co within one week of receipt of the revisions. regardless of the objections, continue to update the schedule with the co's revisions until a mutual agreement in the revisions is reached. if the contractor fails to submit alternative revisions within one week of receipt of the co's proposed revisions, the contractor will be deemed to have concurred with the co's proposed revisions. 1.12 ownership of float float available in the schedule, at any time, must not be considered for the exclusive use of either the government or the contractor. 1.13 payment include an updated schedule with each progress payment request submitted. the updated schedule will be used as a basis to evaluate the contractor's progress for purposes of payment. lack of an updated schedule will result in an inability of the co to perform a full evaluation of the contractor's progress. failure to provide all information, as specified, must result in the disapproval of the entire project schedule submission. the co may withhold payment until the contractor's schedule has been approved by the section 01 32 01.00 25 page 14 msh sediment retention structure crest raise government. in the case where project schedule revisions have been directed by the co and those revisions have not been included in the project schedule, the co may hold retainage up to the maximum allowed by contract, each payment period, until revisions to the project schedule have been made. 1.14 transfer of schedule data into rms cm download and upload the schedule data into the resident management system contractor mode (rms cm), section 01 45 00.15 25, resident management system contractor mode (rms cm), prior to databases being transferred to the government and is considered to be additional supporting data in a form and detail required by the co pursuant to far 52.232-5, payments under fixed-price construction contracts. the receipt of a proper payment request pursuant to far 52.232-27, prompt payment for construction contracts, is contingent upon the government receiving both acceptable and approvable hard copies and electronic export from rms cm of the application for progress payment. part 2 products not used part 3 execution not used -- end of section -- section 01 32 01.00 25 page 15 msh sediment retention structure

(3) column (e): lists one principal paragraph in specification section where a material or product is specified. this listing is only to facilitate locating submitted requirements. do not consider entries in column (e) as limiting project requirements. c. thereafter, track all submittals by maintaining a complete list, including completion of all data columns, including dates on which submittals are received and returned by the government. 1.5.2 use of submittal register submit submittal register with project schedule and qc plan. verify that all submittals required for work are listed and add missing submittals. coordinate, update, and complete the fields on the submitted register in rms cm with the project schedule and qc plan. 1.5.3 government approved submittals 1.5.3.1 quantity of submittals sd-01, sd-02, sd-03, and sd-05 through sd-11 submittals: upload submittals with corresponding eng 4025-r transmittal forms (attachment a2) as outlined in paragraph entitled e-submittals. sd-04 submittals: submit two samples of "g" submittals with two corresponding eng 4025-r transmittal forms, unless otherwise specified. upon completion of review, "g" submittal copies will be marked with an action code, dated, electronically signed, and electronically returned to the contractor as specified below: 1.5.3.2 processing of "g" submittals. a. submittals will be reviewed and processed as follows: (1) approved as submitted (action code "a"): submittals which can be approved without correction will be stamped "approved" and returned electronically to the contractor. (2) approved, except as noted on drawings (action code "b"): submittals which have only minor discrepancies will be annotated in red to indicate necessary corrections. marked material will be stamped "approved except as noted" and returned electronically to the contractor for correction. (3) approved, except as noted on drawings, resubmission required (action code "c"): submittals which are incomplete or require more than minor corrections will be annotated in red to indicate necessary corrections. marked material will be stamped "approved section 01 33 00 page 7 msh sediment retention structure crest raise except as noted - resubmission required" and returned electronically to the contractor for correction. resubmittal of only those items needing correction required. (4) will be returned by separate correspondence (action code "d"): submittals will be addressed by serial letter and respond according to instructions in the letter. (5) disapproved (action code "e"): submittals which are fundamentally in error, cover wrong equipment or construction, or require extensive corrections, will be returned to the contractor stamped "disapproved." submittal will be returned electronically to the contractor and an explanation will be furnished on the submitted material or on eng form 4025-r indicating reason for disapproval. complete resubmittal required. (6) receipt acknowledged (action code "f"): submittals stamped "receipt acknowledged" are complete and returned electronically to the contractor. (7) other (specify) (action code "g"): submittals requiring other specific action will be stamped "other (specify)" and returned with a description in the remarks section. submittal will be returned electronically to the contractor. resubmittal of only those items needing correction required. (8) receipt acknowledged, does not comply (action code "x"): submittals which have been received but do not comply with contract requirements. submittal will be returned electronically to the contractor stamped "receipt acknowledged, does not comply" and an explanation will be furnished. corrective action and resubmittal required. b. resubmittal will not be required for approved submittals unless subsequent changes are made by contractor or by contract modification. for submittals required to be resubmitted, make corrections required, note any changes by dating the revisions to correspond with the change request date, and promptly resubmit the corrected material. resubmittals must be associated with the "parent" by use of sequential numbers (for example, resubmittal of transmittal 8 will be 8.1, 8.2, etc). government costs incurred after the first resubmittal may be charged to the contractor. 1.5.4 information only submittals 1.5.4.1 general upload submittal with corresponding eng 4025 forms as outlined in paragraph entitled e-submittals. normally information only submittals will not be returned. government approval is not required on information only submittals. these submittals will be used for information purposes. the government reserves the right to require the contractor to resubmit any item found not to comply with the contract. this does not relieve the contractor from the obligation to furnish material conforming to the plans and specifications; will not prevent the co from requiring removal and replacement of nonconforming material incorporated in the work; and does not relieve the contractor of the requirement to furnish samples for testing by the government laboratory or for check testing by the government in those instances where the technical specifications so prescribe. section 01 33 00 page 8 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 1.5.4.2 processing of information only submittals submit information only submittals electronically prior to delivery of the material or equipment to the job site. eng form 4025-r must be marked with the words "contractor approved - information copy only" in the remarks block of the form. submittals will be monitored and spot checks made. when such checks indicate noncompliance, the contractor will be notified by the same method used for government approval submittals. resubmittal of nonconforming information only submittals must be reclassified government approval ("g") and re-submitted electronically for approval. 1.6 submittal coordination 1.6.1 submittal coordination meeting meet with the co, after the preconstruction conference and before any submittals are sent to the co, to further develop the preliminary submittal register (eng form 4288-r). during the meeting identify and group all required items into the categories as shown in paragraph entitled submittal designation. 1.6.2 submittal register eng form 4288-r coordinate the submittal register with the progress schedule and submit within 30 days of notice to proceed. in preparing the final document, allow a minimum of 30 days for review and approval, and possible resubmittal of each item on the register. 1.6.3 submittal register updates the cqc system manager must review the listing at least every 30 days and take appropriate action to maintain an effective system. submit copies of updated or corrected listings to the co at least every 30 days in the quantity specified. 1.7 scheduling schedule and submit concurrently submittals covering component items forming a system or items that are interrelated. adequate time (a minimum of 30 calendar days) must be allowed and shown on the register for government review and approval. no delay damages or time extensions will be allowed for time lost in late submittals. a. coordinate scheduling, sequencing, preparing, and processing of submittals with performance of work so that work will not be delayed by submittal processing. allow for potential resubmittal of requirements. b. submittals called for by the contract documents must be listed on the register. approval by the co does not relieve the contractor of supplying submittals required by the contract documents but which have been omitted from the register. c. re-submit register and annotate monthly with actual submission and approval dates. when all items on the register have been fully approved, no further re-submittal is required. d. carefully control procurement operations to ensure that each individual submittal is made on or before the contractor scheduled section 01 33 00 page 9 msh sediment retention structure crest raise submittal date shown on the approved "submittal register". 1.8 transmittal form (eng form 4025-r) use the sample transmittal form (eng form 4025-r, attachment a2) for submitting both government approval and information only submittals in accordance with the instructions on the reverse side of the form. these forms are included in the rms cm software that the contractor is required to use for this contract, per section 01 45 00.15 25, resident management system contractor mode (rms cm). fill forms in completely prior to submittal. exercise special care to ensure proper listing of the specification paragraph number(s) and contract drawing sheet number(s) pertinent to the data submitted for each item. list each submittal item separately on the form, naming subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer; applicable specification paragraph number(s); drawing/sheet number; pay item number; and any other information needed to identify the item, define its use, and locate it in the work. one or more eng 4025-r forms may be used per specification section, however, do not include more than one specification section per transmittal. 1.9 cross-reference (eng form 4288-r/eng form 4025-r) to provide a cross-reference between the approved submittal register and transmittal forms, record the "transmittal numbers" assigned when submitting items in column "transmittal no." of the eng form 4288-r. the numbers in column "transmittal no." of the submittal register must correspond to the column "item no." on eng form 4025-r. 1.10 submittal procedures upload submittals in accordance with subparagraphs entitled government approved submittals and information only submittals, unless indicated otherwise in the technical specifications. submit a complete collated "reviewers copy" with one eng 4025-r form and attachments (not originals). submit hard copy and electronic copies of record (as-built) drawings and o&m manuals in accordance with the applicable specification sections. 1.10.1 e-submittals the intent of electronic submittals is to expedite the construction process by reducing paperwork, improving information flow, and decreasing turnaround time. transmit all submittals, including either an electronically signed or signed scanned copy of form eng 4025, to the government electronic (pdf) format via email or other secure internet accessible service such as sharefile, procore, submittal exchange, or a ftp site that utilize 256-bit ssl encryption and hosted as sas70 type ii compliant data centers. submittals must be entered and tracked using rms cm (see section 01 45 00.15 25, resident management system contractor mode (rms cm). at completion of contract closeout, provide a minimum of two archival discs (dvd-r) that include all documents and tracking logs. color samples, color charts, or physical material samples must not be transmitted electronically. e-submittals will not relieve the contractor from following all applicable requirements within this and other specifications sections and contract clauses. 1.10.2 approval of submittals by the contractor a. submit names and titles of contractor authorized shop drawing approvers to the co with the eng form 4288-r. supplier or section 01 33 00 page 10 msh sediment retention structure crest raise subcontractors certifications are not acceptable as meeting this requirement. b. before submittal to the co, the contractor's authorized shop drawing approvers must review and correct shop drawings prepared by subcontractors, suppliers, and itself, for completeness and compliance with drawings and specifications. do not use red markings for correcting material to be submitted. red markings are reserved for co's use. c. submittals for government approval must first be contractor-approved and stamped, see paragraph entitled contractor approval stamp. d. submittals not conforming to the requirements of this section will be returned to the contractor for correction and resubmittal. 1.10.3 drawings each drawing must be not larger than d size (22 inches high by 34

- general requirements for shipments and packagings 1.3 definitions 1.3.1 contractor-generated hazardous waste contractor-generated hazardous waste is material that, if abandoned or disposed of, may meet the definition of a hazardous waste. these waste streams typically consist of material brought on site by the contractor to execute work, but are not fully consumed during the course of construction. examples include, but are not limited to, excess paint thinners (i.e. methyl ethyl ketone, toluene), waste thinners, excess paints, excess solvents, waste solvents, excess pesticides, and contaminated pesticide equipment rinse water. the cleanup of contractor spills of hazardous materials or petroleum products may also result in the generation of contractor-generated hazardous waste. 1.3.2 electronics waste electronics waste is discarded electronic devices intended for salvage, recycling, or disposal. 1.3.3 environmental pollution and damage environmental pollution and damage is the presence of chemical, physical, or biological elements or agents that adversely affect human health or welfare; unfavorably alter ecological balances of importance to human life; affect other species of importance to humankind; or degrade the environment aesthetically, culturally or historically. section 01 57 19.00 25 page 5 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 1.3.4 environmental protection environmental protection is the prevention/control of pollution and habitat disruption that may occur during construction. the control of environmental pollution and damage requires consideration of land, water, and air; biological and cultural resources; and includes management of visual aesthetics; noise; solid, chemical, gaseous, and liquid waste; radiant energy and radioactive material as well as other pollutants. 1.3.5 hazardous debris hazardous debris is debris that contains listed hazardous waste (either on the debris surface, or in its interstices, such as pore structure) in accordance with 40 cfr 261. hazardous debris also includes debris that exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste in accordance with 40 cfr 261. 1.3.6 hazardous materials a. hazardous materials as defined in 49 cfr 171 and listed in 49 cfr 172. b. hazardous material is any material that: is regulated as a hazardous material in accordance with 49 cfr 173; or requires a safety data sheet (sds) in accordance with 29 cfr 1910.120; or during end use, treatment, handling, packaging, storage, transportation, or disposal meets or has components that meet or have potential to meet the definition of a hazardous waste as defined by 40 cfr 261 subparts a, b, c, or d. designation of a material by this definition, when separately regulated or controlled by other sections or directives, does not eliminate the need for adherence to that hazard-specific guidance which takes precedence over this section for "control" purposes. such material includes ammunition, weapons, explosive actuated devices, propellants, pyrotechnics, chemical and biological warfare materials, medical and pharmaceutical supplies, medical waste and infectious materials, bulk fuels, radioactive materials, and other materials such as asbestos, mercury, and polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs). 1.3.7 hazardous waste hazardous waste is any material that meets the definition of a solid waste and exhibits a hazardous characteristic (ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity) as specified in 40 cfr 261, subpart c, is listed in 40 cfr 261, subpart d, or is a mixture of a solid waste and one or more hazardous wastes listed in 40 cfr 261, subpart d. 1.3.8 land application land application means spreading or spraying discharge water at a rate that allows the water to percolate into the soil. 1.3.9 national pollutant discharge elimination system (npdes) the npdes permit program controls water pollution by regulating point sources, including stormwater discharges from construction sites, that discharge pollutants into waters of the united states. in the state of washington, the department of ecology has the delegated authority to administer the npdes program and issue permits. section 01 57 19.00 25 page 6 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 1.3.10 oily waste a. oily wastes are materials that are, or were, mixed with petroleum, oils, and lubricants (pols) and have become separated from the pols. oily wastes also refers to materials, including wastewaters, centrifuge solids, filter residues or sludges, bottom sediments, tank bottoms, and sorbents which have come into contact with and have been contaminated by pols. b. this definition includes materials such as oily rags, "kitty litter" sorbent clay and organic sorbent material. these materials may be land filled provided that: it is not prohibited in other state regulations or local ordinances; the amount generated is "de minimis" (a small amount); it is the result of minor leaks or spills resulting from normal process operations; and free-flowing oil has been removed to the practicable extent possible. large quantities of this material, generated as a result of a major spill or in lieu of proper maintenance of the processing equipment, are a solid waste. as a solid waste, perform a hazardous waste determination prior to disposal. as this can be an expensive process, it is recommended that this type of waste be minimized through good housekeeping practices and employee education. 1.3.11 petroleum, oils, and lubricants (pols) pol products include flammable or combustible liquids, such as gasoline, diesel, lubricating oil, used engine oil, hydraulic oil, mineral oil, and cooking oil. 1.3.12 regulated waste regulated wastes are solid wastes that have specific additional federal, state, or local requirements for handling, storage, or disposal. 1.3.13 sediment sediment is soil or other debris that has eroded and has been transported by runoff water or wind. 1.3.14 solid waste solid waste is a solid, liquid, semi-solid or contained gaseous waste. a solid waste can be a hazardous waste, non-hazardous waste, or non-resource conservation and recovery act (rcra) regulated waste. types of solid waste typically generated at construction sites may include: 1.3.14.1 construction debris construction debris is non-hazardous solid material generated during the construction, demolition, or renovation of a structure that exceeds 2.5 inch particle size that is: a manufactured object; plant or animal matter; or natural geologic material (e.g., cobbles and boulders), broken or removed concrete, masonry, rebar, and rock asphalt paving; ceramics; roofing paper and shingles. a mixture of debris and other material is also subject to regulation as debris if the mixture is comprised primarily of debris by volume, based on visual inspection. 1.3.14.2 non-hazardous waste non-hazardous waste is waste that is excluded from, or does not meet, section 01 57 19.00 25 page 7 msh sediment retention structure crest raise hazardous waste criteria in accordance with 40 cfr 262. 1.3.14.3 recyclables recyclables are materials, equipment, and assemblies such as metal parts, wiring, insulated/non-insulated copper wire cable, wire rope, and structural components that are recovered and sold as recyclable. it also includes clean polyethylene terephthalate bottles, cooking oil, used fuel oil, high-grade paper products and corrugated cardboard, stackable pallets in good condition, clean crating material, and clean rubber/vehicle tires. metal containing lead or lead-based paint may be included as recyclable if sold to a scrap metal company with full disclosure of the presence of lead or other metal contaminants. paint cans that meet the definition of empty containers in accordance with 40 cfr 261.7 may be included as recyclable if sold to a scrap metal company. 1.3.14.4 surplus soil surplus soil is existing soil that is in excess of what is required for this work, including aggregates intended, but not used, for on-site mixing of concrete, mortars, and paving. contaminated soil meeting the definition of hazardous material or hazardous waste is not included and must be managed in accordance with paragraph hazardous waste/debris management. 1.3.14.5 scrap metal this includes scrap and excess ferrous and non-ferrous metals such as reinforcing steel, structural shapes, pipe, and wire that are recovered or collected and managed as scrap. scrap metal meeting the definition of hazardous material or hazardous waste is not included. 1.3.15 surface discharge surface discharge means discharge of water into drainage ditches, storm sewers, creeks or "waters of the united states". surface discharges are discrete, identifiable sources and require a permit from the governing agency. comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations. 1.3.16 stormwater stormwater is any portion of precipitation that does not naturally percolate into the ground or evaporate, but flows via overland flow, interflow, pipes, or other features of a stormwater drainage system into a defined surface waterbody, or a constructed stormwater management facility. 1.3.17 wastewater wastewater is any water used or generated during construction, including groundwater, that contains contaminants, pollutants, or hazardous substances and that must be managed to prevent discharge to waters of the united states or waters of the state. 1.3.18 waters of the united states waters of the united states means federal jurisdictional waters, including wetlands, that are subject to regulation under section 404 of the clean water act or navigable waters, as defined under the rivers and harbors act. section 01 57 19.00 25 page 8 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 1.3.19 wetlands wetlands are areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. 1.3.20 universal waste the universal waste regulations streamline collection requirements for certain hazardous wastes in the following categories: batteries, pesticides, mercury-containing equipment (e.g., thermostats), lamps (e.g., fluorescent bulbs) and aerosol cans. the rule is designed to reduce hazardous waste in the municipal solid waste (msw) stream by making it easier for universal waste handlers to collect these items and send them for recycling or proper disposal. these regulations can be found at 40 cfr 273. 1.4 submittals government approval is required for submittals with a "g" designation; submittals not having a "g" designation are for information only. when used, a designation following the "g" designation identifies the office that will review the submittal for the government. submit the following in accordance with section 01 33 00, submittal procedures: sd-01 preconstruction submittals environmental preconstruction survey environmental protection plan; g stormwater pollution and prevention plan (swppp); g ecdg application for npdes permit; g sd-06 test reports swppp modifications; g ecdg inspections and reports; g sd-11 closeout submittals environmental records binder; g stormwater notice of termination; g 1.5 general environmental protection requirements comply with federal, state, and local regulations pertaining to the environment, including water, air, solid waste, hazardous waste and substances, oily substances, and noise pollution. tests and procedures assessing whether construction operations comply with applicable environmental laws must be performed by qualified laboratories, and where required by law, the laboratories must be certified. section 01 57 19.00 25 page 9 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 1.6 environmental permits and commitments obtain all permits and licenses required for this project as stated in this section and in accordance with far 52.236-7 permits and responsibilities. provide an electronic copy of each permit or license obtained by the contractor to the government. comply with all environmental permits and commitments required by federal, state, regional, and local environmental laws and regulations. 1.7 quality control 1.7.1 environmental preconstruction survey a. prior to the start of any onsite construction activities, perform an environmental preconstruction survey of the project site with the contracting officer (co), and take photographs showing existing environmental conditions in and adjacent to the site as described in paragraph titled documentation of environmental conditions. submit a report for the record. include in the report a plan describing the features requiring protection under the provisions of the contract clauses, which are not specifically identified on the drawings as environmental features requiring protection along with the condition of trees, shrubs and grassed areas immediately adjacent to the site of work and adjacent to the contractor's assigned storage area and access route(s), as applicable. the contractor and the co will sign this survey report upon mutual agreement regarding its accuracy and completeness. protect those environmental features included in the survey report and any indicated on the drawings, regardless of interference that their preservation may cause to the work under the contract. b. provide photographs of all typical vegetation at sites planned for disturbance (i.e. grassland, wetland, forest). these photographs will be used as reference for sites planned for revegetation. photographs must adequately reflect "foliar densities" at pre-construction conditions. 1.7.2 environmental coordination meeting a. prior to initiating any work on site, meet with the co to discuss the proposed environmental protection plan (epp). submit the epp 14 days before the environmental coordination meeting. develop a mutual understanding relative to the details of environmental protection, including measures for protecting natural and cultural resources, required reports, required permits, permit requirements (such as mitigation measures), and other measures to be taken. b. provide the following information for the meeting agenda: types, quantities, and use of hazardous materials that will be brought onto the project site; and types and quantities of wastes/wastewater that may be generated during the contract. discuss the results of the environmental preconstruction survey at this time. 1.7.3 non-compliance notifications the co will notify the contractor in writing of any observed noncompliance with federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations, permits, and other elements of

the survey narrative, however the extent and coverage of the data collected was limited by deep, moving water and sediments that covered the bedrock surface. the government generally considers the pre-construction data to be insufficient for quality assurance and quality control during construction and additional data is necessary. b. existing bedrock survey no. 1: the bedrock and existing roller-compacted concrete (rcc) surface of the existing spillway (full width) extending from the limits of the first raise to limits of the second and beyond to the full extent of the spillway width extending in the down stream direction (at least)to the dashed line on c-007 with a label "no diversion area". this will require a survey at different times depending on the contractor's dewatering plan. construction activities executed under this contract will have access to the bedrock surface afforded by dewatering and foundation preparation. c. rcc footprint survey no.2: the second survey will cover the entire prepared surface for the rcc and plunge pool. d. top of rcc survey no.3: the third survey will define the breaklines and grades for the completed rcc and be used for as-built drawing submittals by contractor specified in section 01 78 39.10 25 as-built drawings. it will also be used for quantity calculations and payment. e. topographic surveys and maps of the bedrock are

term "surveyor" must also include professional civil engineers authorized to practice land surveying under the laws of the state in which they practice. c. break lines: breaklines are a series of points with x, y, z coordinates that are connected to one another by linear segments. these segments are represented by polylines, lines or shapes in autocad. two or more points are required to define a breakline. breaklines represent discontinuities in the ground surface being surveyed such as an abrupt change in slope, ridges, ditches, top edges of concrete walls, and front and back of wall where earth and concrete meet. breaklines can also represent the limits of riprap, gravel surfacing, cobble armor, edges of pavement, and edges of concrete, etc. when triangulating a surface that contains breakline data, triangles are formed so that no triangle side crosses a breakline segment. the breakline holds a linear relationship that might otherwise be removed during triangulation. breaklines should not cross one another unless they have a crossing point with the same x, y and z (coordinate). d. random points: represent randomly occurring points with x,y,z coordinates. random points are collected because they are points that generally define the surface and can be uniformly or non-uniformly spaced. random points are referred to as regular points, spots elevation or ground shots. random points are also surveyed at high and low spots in the topography. e. sufficient density: data collection for breaklines or random points section 01 71 23.16 25 page 3 msh sediment retention structure crest raise of survey that capture all necessary surface topography. random and breakline points must be surveyed at intervals to meet the map accuracy standards to create a 1"=30' map and

spillway channel from the downstream limits of the first spillway raise to the limits of this second rcc raise and beyond to the limits of the cleared vegetation area on c-005. existing rcc must be prepared and cleaned prior to the bedrock survey to ensure extents are captured. b. the data must be of sufficient density and accuracy to compute volumes of roller-compacted concrete (rcc) placed for the spillway raise. c. it is anticipated that there will be enough exposed bedrock in the channel outside the rcc placement area that a reasonable topographic surface can be created and still meet the mapping standards specified. if substantial sediment deposits exist on the bedrock, they must be illustrated on the prepared map. d. collect an orthophoto of the prepared bedrock surface for each de-watered area of the rcc footprint, understanding that this will require two photos covering the entire spillway limits of construction shown on the plans and at least 100 feet beyond. the contract drawings show an orthophoto of the spillway channel during the first spillway raise that does not meet this specification because the surface was not fully prepared at the time of the photo collection. 3.3 rcc footprint survey a survey and map of the final prepared surface for the rcc including the plunge pool excavation is required to verify the elevations for quality assurance, quality control, and quantity calculations. contractor to submit electronic survey data files for use by the government. the data must be of sufficient density and accuracy with appropriate break lines to

american society of safety professionals (assp) assp a10.6 (2006) safety & health program requirements for demolition operations - american national standard for construction and demolition operations u.s. army corps of engineers (usace) em 385-1-1 (2024) safety -- safety and occupational health (soh) requirements 1.2 project description 1.2.1 definitions 1.2.1.1 decommission to take something out of service, by any combination of closure operations, demolition and deconstruction - see below. 1.2.1.2 demolition demolition is the process of wrecking or taking out any load-supporting structural member of a facility together with any related handling and disposal operations. 1.2.1.3 deconstruction deconstruction is the process of taking apart a facility with the primary goal of preserving the value of all useful building materials. 1.2.1.4 decommissioning plan decommission plan is the planned steps and processes for managing demolition and other activities required for closure and identifying the required sequencing activities and disposal mechanisms. 1.2.1.5 leaks leaks are any flow from pipes, valves, equipment or penetration and contacts with concrete exceeding a flow rate of one gallon in an 24 hour time interval. section 02 41 00.00 25 page 2 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 1.2.2 demolition/deconstruction plan the outlets works must be decommissioned to permanently close all conduits through the dam to prevent any undue seepage of water or loss of control of the reservoir. there is no value to the government in any deconstructed items. prepare a decommissioning plan and submit proposed procedures for approval 60 days before work is started. include procedures for careful removal and disposition of materials specified. include a detailed description of methods and equipment to be used for each operation and of the sequence of operations. coordinate with section 01 57 19.00 25, temporary environmental controls for addressing any liquid discharge or abatement of lead and asbestos. include statements affirming contractor inspection of the existing roof deck and its suitability to perform as a safe working platform or if inspection reveals a safety hazard to workers, state provisions for securing the safety of the workers throughout the performance of the work. include statements including any critical lifts by cranes or special design of platforms or scaffolding inside valve pit outside the monolith structure. provide procedures for safe conduct of the work in accordance with em 385-1-1. plan must be approved by contracting officer (co) prior to work beginning. 1.2.3 outlet works the outlet works has 30 through-pipes (36 inch diameter)left over from historical reservoir operations. the pipes extend from the upstream side to the downstream side. the upstream end of the through-pipes are underwater and saturated loose sediment. the slide gates on the top five pipes are closed. the pipes extend through a valve pit about 6 feet wide in the downstream direction. there is a knife valve on 25 of the 30 through-pipes on the upstream side of the valve pit. some of the valves are continually leaking and present a problem for placing and curing concrete around them for decommissioning purposes. the water leaks must be mitigated for under this contract as described below. the remaining five pipes on the upper level are only run with the sluice gates on the upstream end. the through pipes are made of steel or concrete depending on location however, portions within the valve pit are all steel. steel segments exist 5 feet upstream of the knife valve and 15-feet downstream. the valve pit is drained by six pipes (8 inch diameter) extending through 10 feet of concrete on the downstream side. the valve pit is considered confined space per em 385-1-1. government assumes the steel pipes with open sluice gates and closed knife gates are partially filled with sediment because some of the leaking valves have passed sediment into the valve pit. the ventilation and lighting systems were operable during the last inspection in march 2021, but those systems cannot be relied upon for this contract. the valves for the steel pipes operate on a pneumatic system. the pneumatic air system does not work. there is no need to operate the valves for decommissioning purposes. there is 6 to 18 inches of sediment in the base of the valve pit. detailed record drawings of the valve pit and all features inside are provided in fifo drawings. 1.2.4 general requirements do not begin demolition or deconstruction until authorization is received from the co. remove rubbish and debris from the project site; do not allow accumulations inside or outside the outlet works except for approved staging areas. in the interest of occupational safety and health, perform the work in accordance with em 385-1-1, section 23, demolition, and other applicable sections. required activities for decommissioning include but are not limited to the list below: section 02 41 00.00 25 page 3 msh sediment retention structure crest raise a. the outlet works contains 30 steel pipes that are 36-inches diameter. 25 of those pipes have knife valve closures and 5 are open pipes. the last government inspection in 2021 identified 6 leaking valves that will require hot tapping or an alternate plug method as noted in part 1.2.4(c). without a recent inspection the current conditions in the valve pit are unknown. the 25 pipes fitted with valves forms the baseline valve hot tapping quantity for this contract. document the pipes and valves with leaking conditions as defined in part 1.2.1.5 leaks and submit a valve inspection report to the co for approval. b. hot tap the leaking knife valves and pressurize with controlled low strength material (clsm) per section 03 52 01.00 25 or other type of sealant to be reviewed and approved by the co. the box should be capable of draining the leaking water and have a port for pumping the clsm. the valve stem may be removed. the box or pump system must have a pressure measuring device for quality control. the box must be capable of containing a minimum pressures of 30 pounds per square inch. the box must conform to at least two surfaces, (1) the vertical face of the concrete upstream of the valve and (2) the circumference of the steel pipe downstream of the valve. the hot tap is intended to be permanent. c. if the valve is leaking into the pipe, extend the hot tap in such a way as to plug the pipe at the same time. submit a shop drawing of the planned fabrication along with the decommissioning plan. (contractor may submit to the co for approval an alternate plan to plug the steel pipe upstream of the knife valve if effective in stopping leaks.) d. clean and plug all steel through pipes (30) with controlled low strength material (clsm) per section 03 52 01.00 25 or other type of sealant to be reviewed and approved by the co. the inside of the pipes must be cleaned of all sediment and debris. the plug extends from the knife valve to the downstream end of the steel pipe. place temporary covers on the downstream end of the steel through pipes. specify how the temporary covers will be fixed in the decommissioning plan. no permanent covers are allowed since the historic appearance must be maintained. e. there are six pipes (illustrated on the record drawings) that drain the valve pit, all 8 inch diameter. maintain drainage operation until the valve pit is filled with concrete. block the entrance of the drainage pipes at the appropriate time to prevent from being filled with concrete. f. remove all steel bolted to the interior of the valve pit including grating and structural supports, ventilation pipes, all electrical conductors and conduits, all pneumatic lines, and other miscellaneous items identified during the initial survey. also remove any ventilation, electrical panels and hatch covers on the roof deck. g. clean mud from bottom of valve pit. h. place a layer of filter gravel on the bottom of the valve pit. the gravel must be open graded crushed or uncrushed rock meeting sot specification 9-03.12(4) gravel backfill for drains. build a screen section 02 41 00.00 25 page 4 msh sediment retention structure crest raise for the lowest drain pipe at elevation 880 feet. the screen should extend at least 2 inches above the crown of the pipe and extend down to the pit floor and fastened to the vertical concrete face to prevent movement during filter and clsm placement. the screen must be hyde and have holes 3/8 inch diameter drilled at center spacing of 3/4 inch. the screen should be capable of resisting forces due to the filter rock layer and overlying liquid clsm. the gravel must be a minimum of 8 inches deep across the pit floor and extend above the crown of the lowest drainage pipe at elevation 880 feet. cover the filter gravel with a non-woven geotextiles and secure it so as to maintain horizontal coverage while placing clsm above it. include details of the screen and filter product source and method of securing textile placenta in the decommissioning plan. i. fill the valve pit from bottom to elevation 939 feet at the roof deck with controlled low strength material (clsm) per section 03 52 01.00 25, controlled low strength material (clsm). clsm must be flush with existing concrete surface. 1.3 availability of work areas all staging areas will be available for the purpose of this work throughout the period of performance and these activities are not subject to in-water work windows. 1.4 submittals government approval is required for submittals with a "g" classification. submittals not having a "g" classification are for information only. when used, a code following the "g" classification identifies the office that will review the submittal for the government. submit the following in accordance with section 01 33 00, submittal procedures: sd-01 preconstruction submittals decommissioning plan; g existing

the foundation survey. after initiation of rcc production, the contractor's schedule must be updated and adjusted on a weekly basis for the duration of the rcc placement. if it becomes apparent for any reason that the contractor is not pursuing a schedule that will meet the specified rcc production dates, actions necessary to increase the production rate must be taken so that production is once again on schedule, within five calendar days after written notice. also, if not back on schedule by the end of the seven day period, the government reserves the right at this time to direct the contractor, at no additional cost to the government, to increase the amount and size of crews and equipment. section 03 37 23.00 25 page 28 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 3.1.2 rcc

the rcc must be cleaned prior to placing any additional concrete thereon. after cleaning, concrete and bedding mortar are to be used specifically for achieving bond between different types of concrete and foundation and eliminating and preventing segregation or voids along margins or rcc placements. no surfaces to receive concrete or bedding mortar must be covered with rcc until the prepared surfaces have been accepted in writing and that acceptance has been recorded on an approved checkout form. all surfaces upon which rcc or any bedding mortar placed must be moist (but contain no visible free water). prior to placing any concrete adjacent to and at the same time as the rcc, all surfaces must be clean and free of loose, unkeyed, or deteriorated rock; all mud and silt accumulations; vegetation; laitance; puddles or ponds of free surface water; coatings; and any other detrimental materials. high-pressure water jetting, or wet sandblasting, followed by mild high-volume, low-pressure washing, must be used on all hardened concrete surfaces (cold joints) as necessary for the removal of laitance, coatings, stains, or other difficult-to-remove contaminants. high-volume low-pressure water washing or water jetting may be used for removal of loose materials. adequate equipment with operators must be on hand at the site to clean all surfaces in conformance with these specifications without disrupting in any way the rcc production as scheduled. 3.1.5.2 high-volume low-pressure washing washing of loose materials can be accomplished with high-volume low-pressure water washing or air water jetting using equipment of similar design to that used in large-scale foundation cleanups. the air-water jets must have 1 1/2 inch nozzles, a water supply of at least 30 gpm, and compressed air at the jet of 80 to 120 psi. the low-pressure water jets must have one inch nozzles available and a capacity of at least 200 gpm for truck-mounted devices. 3.1.5.3 high-pressure water jet a stream of water under a pressure of not less than 1,500 psi for rcc and 4,000 psi for conventional concrete must be used for cleaning all cold joint surfaces, or surfaces with laitance, mortar coatings, stains, or other difficult-to-remove contaminants. there must be no undercutting of coarse-size aggregates. aggregate particles that are undercut must be removed. for cleaning large open areas larger than 5,000 square feet, the high-pressure water jet system must be truck-mounted. for cleaning small or confined areas, the high-pressure water jet system must be

advancing edge in a sloping and uniform fan-like manner. rcc must be deposited (from the conveyor, section 03 37 23.00 25 page 30 msh sediment retention structure crest raise end-dump truck, or front-end loader) on the uncompacted rcc of the advancing edge in a forward direction from the dump pile. rcc must not be placed in consecutive or consistent lanes. the dump location must be varied to avoid "lane" construction. the interval between batch plant mixing and final rcc compaction must be no greater than 45 minutes. final compaction is defined as: any rcc lift composed of layers that have been worked twice by dozer grousers, receives four passes with the vibratory roller, and meets the density requirements. 3.2.2 bedding mortar the bedding mortar must be applied to the existing surface following any required cleanup. the bedding mortar must be applied not more than 15 minutes ahead of rcc placement, unless otherwise approved. the bedding mortar must be used between hardened conventional concrete and rcc, between different rcc placements where cold joints occur, and other locations as directed or as shown in the drawings. the bedding mortar must have an average thickness after application of between 1/4 and 1/2 inch and must cover 100 percent of the lift area. 3.2.3 lift thickness the total lift thickness after final compaction by the vibratory roller must be 12 inches. 3.2.4 depositing, spreading, and remixing after the rcc has been deposited, the rcc must be spread by dozers into gently sloping layers, approximately 6 inches thick, that will, after final compaction of the several layers by the vibratory roller, result in the specified lift thickness. during the spreading process, the dozer operators must continuously work the rcc surfaces with the dozer blade and grousers in a manner to remix any rcc that may contain pockets of segregated material and to compact the material. all surfaces of each layer must receive at least two passes with the grousers. the dozers must be operating continuously during the spreading process, even if this action results in more than two passes. a front-end loader with operator must be available to assist with depositing and spreading rcc as needed in confined areas, at the abutments, and at other locations approved or directed. in no case must the rcc, or bedding mortar be allowed to dry. under no conditions must a dozer or other tracked vehicle be operated on other than fresh uncompacted rcc except at the start of each lift placement to facilitate startup operations, and then only by an approved procedure. no rcc or other concrete must be placed on a previous lift which has not met specification. unacceptable material must be removed. 3.2.5 compaction/consolidation after spreading and working with the dozers, the top surface of each lift must be compacted with a minimum of four, plus as many additional passes with a self-propelled double-drum vibratory roller operating in the vibratory mode as are required to obtain a minimum of 98 percent of the theoretical density. a round trip over the same material must count as two passes (i.e., from point a to point b and return to point a by the same route is two passes). rollers must not be operated in the vibratory mode unless they are moving section 03 37 23.00 25 page 31 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 3.2.5.1 theoretical density (td) determination the td is defined as the theoretical density (unit weight) of the concrete, pounds per cubic foot, computed to including air content. the td value to be used during construction will be determined using job mixture proportions and contractor supplied materials; and, using compaction techniques suitable for rcc, and following the appropriate testing procedures used to determined theoretical unit weight of concrete as described as in astm c138/c138m. 3.2.5.2 required compaction density all rcc must be compacted to a minimum of 98 percent of the td value. the anticipated td, estimated from laboratory test data is approximately 160 pounds per cubic foot. 3.2.5.3 density determination of compacted rcc density must be measured using a nuclear density meter in accordance with astm c1040/c1040m. rcc density value determinations must be made throughout the course of rcc placement to assure that the rcc is compacted to a minimum 98 percent of the td and detect segregation or voids throughout the rcc. submit findings of all tests as part of the concrete strength report. 3.2.5.4 additional compaction if more than four passes are required to achieve the required density, the additional passes must be made at no additional cost to the government. 3.2.6 lift joints the entire rcc mass must be placed with sufficient continuity so that it hardens and acts as one monolithic block without discontinuous joints or potential planes of separation. all lift joints must be kept clean, uncontaminated, free from ponded water, and continuously moist until placement of the succeeding rcc or other concrete. 3.2.6.1 regular lift-joint treatment a. lift joints that have not hardened or dried and are less than 72 hours old must be given the regular lift-joint treatment. submit the method and equipment proposed for joint cleanup and waste disposal for review by the co not later than 30 days after notice to proceed for conformance with specifications. regular lift-joint treatment and maintenance must include: (1) maintaining 100 percent of each compacted lift-joint surface continuously moist, (2) if necessary, removing all loose contaminants or deteriorated rcc by low-pressure washing or vacuuming, and (3) application of a 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick bedding mortar over the entire placement surface area immediately before placement of the next lift. b. for regular lift-joint treatment, no washing or vacuuming will be necessary provided damage or contamination of the lift surface is section 03 37 23.00 25 page 32 msh sediment retention structure crest raise prevented. 3.2.6.2 cold joints a. a cold joint is any vertical or horizontal rcc surface: (1) that does not receive the next rcc lift within 72 hours, (2) in which the rcc has been allowed to dry, or (3) that has been contaminated to the extent that contaminants cannot be removed using low-pressure water. b. cold joints must be prepared for the next lift by the methods and procedures in paragraph surface preparation above, prior to resumption of rcc placement. following this initial preparation, the cold-joint surface must be kept continuously moist until application of the bedding mortar. whenever a cold joint at any edge or end of any lift occurs, it must be located at least 30 feet from the location of other cold joints that may have previously occurred in the same direction along previous lifts. 3.2.6.3 unplanned cold joints cold joints between adjacent placements of rcc must not be scheduled. however, if an unplanned joint occurs, it must be treated as follows: a. unplanned cold-joints will be treated as described above. additionally they must be treated as described hereafter. b. shoulders must be broken down and feathered out such that the vertical rise does not exceed the layer height for each horizontal distance equal to the roller width, and c. the hardened rcc surface must be prepared for receiving the next layer of rcc by cleaning with air supplemented with water to remove all loose material. rcc surfaces which are to receive additional concrete are considered to be cold joints if the hardened rcc surface is over 72 hours old, or has been contaminated to the extent that contaminants cannot be removed using low pressure water. 3.2.6.4 vertical joints joints for sloping, near-vertical or vertical rcc surfaces are considered to be vertical joints. a vertical joint most often will occur when an rcc placement is terminated before the entire rcc placement for that lift has been completed. when it does become apparent that placement of rcc will be terminated prior to completion of a lift, the rcc spreading procedure at the leading zone of the placement must be adjusted to provide a gradual tapered slope to complete that lift. the taper must be no steeper than 25 horizontal on one vertical. where the tapered slope meets the underlying hardened lift surface, care must be taken to prevent or remove any segregated or uncompacted material. the tapered surface must be compacted in accordance with paragraph compaction/consolidation above. prior to resumption of rcc placements, the tapered surface must be prepared in accordance with paragraph surface preparation above. section 03 37 23.00 25 page 33 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 3.2.7 downstream face the downstream sloped face of the dam and the exposed slopes of the stilling basin training walls must be constructed using sacrificial rcc on 1.0 vertical to 0.9 horizontal slope. the slope must be constructed to the tolerances specified. each rcc lift must be overbuilt at least 12 inches, and it must subsequently be trimmed to the surface smoothness tolerance. trimming must be performed before the rcc is more than 48 hours old. the process must be demonstrated during the test section. trimming must be done in such a manner to prevent damage to the surface and interior rcc. 3.3 curing and protection submit the curing media and methods to be used for review to the co 14 days before concrete placement begins for conformance with specifications. 3.3.1 curing the surface of every rcc lift must be kept continuously moist, commencing immediately after compaction, by use of water trucks equipped with fog sprayers for 14 days or until the surface is covered with the next lift. uncompacted sacrificial rcc, need not be cured. concrete that is moist cured must be maintained continuously, not periodically, wet for the duration of the entire curing period. water for curing must comply with the requirements of paragraph entitled water. if the water or mats cause staining or discoloration of permanently exposed concrete surfaces, the surfaces must be cleaned by a method approved by the co. when wood or metal forms are left in place during curing, the forms must be kept continuously wet, except for sealed insulation curing in cold weather. rcc may be cured with saturated cotton or burlap mats in lieu of the approved fog spraying equipment. the rcc must meet a 7 day minimum compressive strength of 2,500 psi prior to releasing water over the newly placed concrete. 3.3.2 hot-weather protection when ambient air temperatures exceeds 90 degrees f and as soon as the conventional concrete and rcc is sufficiently hard to withstand washing of surface mortar, water by fog spraying must be applied in a controlled manner to provide evaporative cooling. water must be applied at such a rate that it quickly evaporates and such that the surface remains continuously moist without ponding. in addition, when surface materials begin to dry and while the rcc placement, spreading, and compaction process is still underway and until the concrete has sufficiently hardened to permit the above water spray, hand-held fog spraying must be applied to the concrete surfaces as directed to prevent drying out of concrete materials and replace moisture lost to evaporation. these hot-weather protection procedures will require additional labor(s) to assure complete coverage of the entire surface areas to prevent unacceptable damage to the rcc and conventional concrete. submit a description of the materials and methods proposed for protection of the concrete, when concrete is to be placed under hot-weather conditions, to the co for review 30 days in advance of anticipated need date. section 03

use of figure 2.1.5 of aci 305r, may reasonably be expected to exceed 0.2 lb/sq ft per hour, provisions for windbreaks, shading, fog spraying, or wet covering with a light-colored material must be made in advance of placement, and such protective measures must be taken as quickly as finishing operations will allow. all unformed surfaces that are not to be covered by additional concrete or backfill must have a float finish, unless a trowel finish is specified, and must be true to the elevation shown. surfaces to receive additional concrete or backfill must be brought to the elevation shown in the drawings and left true and regular. exterior surfaces must be sloped for drainage unless otherwise shown or as directed. joints must be carefully made with a jointing or edging tool. the finished surfaces must be protected from stains or abrasions. 3.5 tests and inspections 3.5.1 general perform the inspection and tests as described below, and based upon the results of these inspections and tests, he must take the action required and submit reports as required. when, in the opinion of the co, the concreting operation is out of control, concrete placement must cease. the laboratory performing the tests must be on-site and must conform with astm c1077. the individuals who sample and test concrete or the constituents of concrete as required in this specification must have demonstrated a knowledge and ability to perform the necessary test procedures equivalent to the aci minimum guidelines for certification of concrete field testing technicians, grade i. the individual who performs the inspection must have demonstrated a knowledge and ability equivalent to section 03 37 23.00 25 page 35 msh sediment retention structure crest raise the aci minimum guidelines for certification of concrete construction inspector (cci), level ii. the government will inspect the laboratory, equipment, and test procedures prior to start of concreting operations and at least once per year thereafter for conformance with astm c1077. 3.5.2 testing and inspection requirements 3.5.2.1 fine aggregate 3.5.2.1.1 grading at least once during each shift when the concrete plant is operating, there must be one sieve analysis and fineness modulus determination in accordance with astm c136/c136m, astm c117, and coe crd-c 104 for the fine aggregate or for each fine aggregate if it is batched in more than one size or classification. the location at which samples are taken may be selected by the contractor as the most advantageous for control. however, the contractor is responsible for delivering fine aggregate to the mixer within specification limits. the results must be recorded on a sheet on which are also shown the specification limits applicable to the project. 3.5.2.1.2 fineness-modulus control chart results for fineness modulus must be grouped in sets of three consecutive tests, and the average and range of each group must be plotted on a control chart. the upper and lower control limits for average must be drawn 0.10 units above and below the target fineness modulus, and the upper control limit for range must be 0.20. 3.5.2.1.3 corrective action for fine aggregate grading when the amount passing on any sieve is outside the specification limits, the fine aggregate must be immediately resampled and retested. if there is another failure on any sieve, the fact must immediately be reported to the co. whenever a point on the fineness modulus control chart, either for average or range, is beyond one of the control limits, the frequency of testing must be doubled. if two consecutive points are beyond the control limits, the process must be considered out of control and concreting must be stopped. the co must be notified, and immediate steps must be taken to rectify the situation. after two consecutive points have fallen within the control limits, testing at the normal frequency may be resumed. 3.5.2.1.4 moisture content testing when in the opinion of the co the electric moisture meter is not operating satisfactorily, there must be at least four tests for moisture content in accordance with astm c566 during each eight hour period of mixing plant operation. the times for the tests must be selected randomly within the eight hour period. an additional test must be made whenever the slump is out of control or excessive variation in workability is reported by the placing foreman. when an electric moisture meter is operating satisfactorily, at least two direct measurements of moisture content must be made per week to check the calibration of the meter. the results of tests for moisture content must be used to adjust the added water in the control of the batch plant. 3.5.2.1.5 moisture content corrective action whenever the moisture content of the fine aggregate changes by 0.5 percent section 03 37 23.00 25 page 36 msh sediment retention structure crest raise or more from the previous sample, the scale settings for the fine aggregate batcher and water batcher must be adjusted (directly or by means of a moisture compensation device). 3.5.2.2 coarse aggregate 3.5.2.2.1 grading at least once during each shift in which the concrete plant is operating, there must be a sieve analysis in accordance with astm c136/c136m for each size of coarse aggregate. the location at which samples are taken may be selected by the contractor as the most advantageous for production control. a test record of samples of aggregate taken at the same locations must show the results of the current test as well as the average results of the five most recent tests including the current test. the contractor may adopt limits for control coarser than the specification limits for samples taken other than as delivered to the mixer to allow for degradation during handling. when facilities are available to test samples five times as large as those required in astm c136/c136m, no averaging must be done. 3.5.2.2.2 corrective action for grading when the amount passing any sieve is outside the specification limits, the coarse aggregate must be immediately resampled and retested. if the second sample fails on any sieve, that fact must be reported to the co. where two consecutive averages of five tests (or two consecutive tests where large samples are used) are outside specification limits, the operation must be considered out of control, and that fact must be reported to the co, concreting must be stopped, and immediate steps must be taken to correct the grading. 3.5.2.2.3 coarse aggregate moisture content a test for moisture content of each size group of coarse aggregate must be made at least once a shift. when two consecutive readings for smallest size coarse aggregate differ by more than one percent, frequency of testing must be increased to that specified previously for fine aggregate. 3.5.2.2.4 coarse aggregate moisture corrective action whenever the moisture content of any size of coarse aggregate changes by 0.5 percent or more from the previous sample, the scale setting for the coarse aggregate batcher and the water batcher must be adjusted to compensate for this. 3.5.2.2.5 material finer than the no. 200 sieve when in the opinion of the co, a problem exists in connection with the cleanliness of the coarse aggregate, tests must be made in accordance with astm c117. testing frequency must be as directed. 3.5.2.2.6 corrective action for material finer than the no. 200 sieve when material finer than the no. 200 sieve exceeds one percent of the weight of the coarse aggregate finer than 1 1/2 inch or 0.5 percent of the weight of the aggregate coarser than 1 1/2 inch, the co must be notified, and steps, such as washing or other corrective action, must be initiated immediately. section 03 37 23.00 25 page 37 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 3.5.2.3 quality of aggregates 3.5.2.3.1 frequency of quality tests prior to submitting samples for mixture proportioning studies, perform the tests for aggregate quality in the following list. in addition, after the start of concrete placement, perform tests for aggregate quality during concrete or aggregate production, in accordance with the following frequency schedule. samples tested after the start of concrete placement must be taken immediately prior to entering the concrete mixer. frequency property fine aggregate coarse aggregate test specific gravity every 30 days every 30 days astm c127 astm c128 absorption every 30 days every 30 days astm c127 astm c128 flat and elongate not applicable every 30 days astm d4791 3.5.2.3.2 corrective action for aggregate quality if the result of a quality test fails to meet the requirements for quality during submittal of samples for mixture-proportioning studies or immediately prior to start of concrete placement, production procedures or materials must be changed and additional tests must be performed until the material meets the quality requirements prior to proceeding with either mixture-proportioning studies or starting concrete placement. after concrete placement commences, whenever the result of a test for quality fails the requirements, the test must be rerun immediately. if the second test fails the quality requirement, the fact must be reported to the co and immediate steps taken to rectify the situation. 3.5.2.4 compressive strength testing at least one set of test specimens will be made each day on each different mixture placed during each shift. additional sets of test cylinders will be made, as directed by the co, when the mixture proportions are changed or when low strengths have been detected. a random sampling plan will be developed and approved by the co prior to the start of construction. sampling must be random in accordance with the requirements of astm d3665. a set of test specimens for concrete with a 90-day strength will consist of six cylinders, two tested at seven days, two at 28 days, and two at 90 days. test specimens will be 6 inch diameter by 12 inches, molded in accordance with astm c1176/1176m or astm c1435/c1435m, protected and cured in accordance with astm c31/c31m, and tested in accordance with astm c39/c39m. all compressive-strength tests will be reported immediately to the co. quality control charts must be kept for individual strength tests, moving average for strength, and moving average for range for each mixture. the charts must be similar to those found in aci 214r. 3.5.2.5 vebe consistency for each set of strength specimens as

must be reported as part of the contractor's quality control program. 3.5.2.6 scales 3.5.2.6.1 weighing accuracy the accuracy of the scales must be checked by test weights at least once a month for conformance with the applicable requirements of paragraphs batch plant and continuous mixing plant both in part 2. such tests must also be made as directed whenever there are variations in properties of the fresh concrete that could result from batching errors. 3.5.2.6.2 batching and recording accuracy once a week the accuracy of each batching and recording device must be checked during a weighing operation by noting and recording the required weight, recorded weight, and the actual weight batched. confirm that the calibration devices described in paragraph batch plant in part 2 for checking the accuracy of dispensed admixtures are operating properly. if a continuous mixing plant is provided, the accuracy and operation of all feeding and dispensing units must be checked before the start of operation each day. 3.5.2.6.3 scales corrective action when the weighing accuracy or batching accuracy does not comply with specification requirements, the plant must not be operated until necessary adjustments or repairs have been made. discrepancies in recording accuracies must be corrected immediately. 3.5.2.7 concrete plant control the measurement of all constituent materials including cementitious materials, each size of aggregate, water, and admixtures must be continuously controlled. the aggregate weights and amount of added water must be adjusted as necessary to compensate for free moisture in the aggregates. a report must be prepared indicating type and source of cement used, type and source of pozzolan or slag used, amount and source of admixtures used, aggregate source, the required aggregate and water weights per cubic yard, amount of water as free moisture in each size of aggregate, and the as-mixed aggregate and water weights per cubic yard for each class of concrete placed during plant operation. 3.5.2.8 field density 3.5.2.8.1 testing and checking density must be determined for at least eight locations per rcc lift with a calibrated nuclear density gauge in accordance with astm c1040/c1040m. densities must be taken at depths of 4 and 8 inches. if the densities at 4 and 8 inches conflict, acceptance must be at the 8 inch depth. 3.5.2.8.2 action required whenever the nuclear gauge indicates density less than the specified density, a retest must be made. if the retest indicates unacceptable density, the co's representative must be notified, additional rolling must be immediately provided, and a determination must be made as to whether the section 03 37 23.00 25 page 39 msh sediment retention structure crest raise lower density resulted from insufficient passes of the roller or a change in the mix properties. if the mix properties have changed, adjustments such as increasing or decreasing the moisture content must be made at the batch plant. if the problem persists, the co may adjust the proportions of aggregates, cement, and pozzolan. if the lower density is the result of incomplete rolling, the operator must be notified and the co may require removal of the incompletely compacted material at no cost to the government. 3.5.2.9 inspection before placing foundation or construction joints, forms, and embedded items must be inspected in sufficient time prior to each concrete placement to certify to the co that they are ready to receive concrete. the results of each inspection must be reported in writing. the inspection of the lift surfaces of the rcc will be a continuing activity and must be accomplished in accordance with paragraph regular lift-joint treatment above. 3.5.2.10 placing inspection 3.5.2.10.1 inspection provide full time supervision of all placing operations to insure that the correct quality of rcc, conventional concrete, or grout is placed in each location and that all other aspects of the placing operation are performed in accordance with the contract. during placing operations, the quality control staff must measure and record concrete temperatures in accordance with astm c1064/c1064m, ambient temperature hourly, record weather conditions, time of placement, yardage placed, and method of placement. 3.5.2.10.2 corrective action the placing foreman must not permit placing to begin until he has verified that an adequate number of vibrators, spreaders, and compactors in working order and with competent operators are available. placing must not be continued if any conventional concrete is inadequately consolidated or if any lift of rcc is not fully compacted. additional compaction, if necessary, must be performed in accordance with paragraph additional compaction above. if any batch of conventional concrete fails to meet the temperature requirements, immediate steps must be taken to improve temperature controls. 3.5.2.11 vibrator tests 3.5.2.11.1 vibrator testing and use the frequency and amplitude of each vibrator must be determined in accordance with coe crd-c 521 prior to initial use and at least once a month when concrete is being placed. additional tests must be made as directed when a vibrator does not appear to be adequately consolidating the concrete. the frequency must be determined while the vibrator is operating in concrete with the tachometer being held against the upper end of the vibrator head while almost submerged and just before the vibrator is withdrawn from the concrete. the amplitude must be determined with the head vibrating in air. two measurements must be taken, one near the tip and another near the upper end of the vibrator head, and these results averaged. the make, model, type, and size of the vibrator and frequency and amplitude results must be reported in writing. in addition, the self-propelled vibratory rollers, as specified in part 2, paragraph primary rollers, must be checked for frequency and amplitude prior to use and once section 03 37 23.00 25 page 40 msh sediment retention structure crest raise every three months when rcc is being placed. 3.5.2.11.2 vibrator corrective action any vibrator not meeting the requirements of paragraph vibrators must be immediately removed from service and repaired or replaced. 3.5.2.12 curing inspection 3.5.2.12.1 moist curing inspections at least twice each shift, and twice per day on nonwork days an inspection must be made of all areas subject to moist curing. the surface moisture condition must be noted and recorded. 3.5.2.12.2 moist curing corrective action when a daily inspection report lists an area of inadequate curing, immediate corrective action must be taken, and the required curing period for those areas must be extended by one day. 3.5.2.13 cold-weather and hot-weather protection at least once each shift and once per day on nonwork days an inspection must be made of all areas subject to cold-weather or hot-weather protection. any deficiencies must be noted, corrected, and reported. 3.5.2.14 cold-weather and hot-weather protection corrective action when a daily inspection report lists deficiencies, the deficiency must be corrected immediately and the period of protection extended for one day. 3.5.3 reports all results of tests or inspections conducted must be reported informally as they are completed and in writing daily. a weekly report must be prepared for the updating of control charts covering the entire period from the start of the construction season through the current week. during periods of cold-weather protection, reports of pertinent temperatures must be made daily. these requirements do not relieve the contractor of the obligation to report certain failures immediately as required in preceding paragraphs. such reports of failures and the action taken must be confirmed in writing in the routine reports. the co has the right to examine all contractor quality control records. -- end of section -- section 03 37 23.00 25 page 41 msh sediment retention structure crest raise section table of contents division 03 - concrete section 03 52 01.00 25

1.1 general information this section covers river diversion during construction. the exact methods for river diversion are not specified. the river diversion methods are the responsibility of the contractor. follow the performance requirements specified in this section for river diversion. 1.2 submittals government approval is required for submittals with a "g" designation; submittals not having a "g" designation are for information only. submit the following in accordance with section 01 33 00, submittal procedures: sd-01 preconstruction submittals river diversion plan; g sd-05 design data cofferdam design; g sd-06 test reports river diversion report 1.3 flow data a. attachment a6, shows daily average discharge curves for various exceedance values. discharge data for usgs gage 14240525, nf toutle river below srs near kid valley, wa, can be found here: http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?14240525. b. the northwest river forecast center provides flow forecasts for the main stem toutle river at the tower road bridge. these forecasts can be found at the following location: http://www.nwrfc.noaa.gov/river/station/flowplot/flowplot.cgi?totw1. c. significant rainfall-runoff driven flow events are rare during the in-water-work-period, but they have occurred within the gage record. the river forecast can be one way of staying informed if flows are expected to change. be aware that forecast data is uncertain and may under or over predict flows or potentially miss an event entirely. if a rainfall event occurs, a change in flow and water surface elevation will likely follow shortly. 1.4 river diversion plan submit a river diversion plan. submit 30 days prior to start of river diversion work. describe the contractor's river diversion system for the duration of the project, including, as a minimum: cofferdams, culverts, and section 30 00 01.00 25 page 2 msh sediment retention structure crest raise other river diversion features; the discharge of the north fork toutle river that the river diversion system is designed to accommodate without flooding the worksite; potential seepage and methods that will be used to handle such seepage; methods for maintaining the minimum discharge for river continuity; methods for maintaining the minimum flow depth; and a statement of concurrence with the river diversion plan by the contractor's professional engineer. in addition, include drawings and figures to illustrate the plan visually. if the contractor elects to install culverts within the rcc structure, include in the river diversion plan all aspects of the activity, including the type(s) of culverts, the plan for installation, and the plan for filling with concrete upon completion of use. a construction photo of the temporary works developed in 2012 is included in drawing c-008 care and diversion of water during construction. the drawing illustrates areas that can be used for diversion and those that cannot. 1.5 professional engineer a registered professional engineer must design the river diversion system. the professional engineer must concur with the river diversion plan. the professional engineer must inspect the river diversion system during initial construction, whenever there is a change in configuration, and during high river flow events. the professional engineer must produce a river diversion report for each site visit documenting all observations, recommendations, and updates to the river diversion system. the professional engineer must be available to meet with the contracting officer at any time throughout the contract duration. update the river diversion plan and re-submit with any changes. submit no later than one day after each site visit by professional engineer. part 2 products not used. part 3 execution 3.1 cofferdams and culverts a. the contractor may construct cofferdams and use culverts as necessary for the river diversion system. as a minimum, the river diversion system must be capable of passing a river discharge of 860 cubic feet per second without flooding the worksite. this flow has a 10 percent chance of exceedance in any given year between july 1 to september 30. extending the work any later would likely experience increased flows and affect the contractor's design. b. the contractor is allowed to install steel or concrete culverts within the rcc structure, for the purpose of river diversion, as long as the following requirements are met: (1) the culverts are strong enough to support the loads from the rcc structure during the river diversion time period. (2) no rcc compacted against the culverts below their springline. (3) place a minimum of two feet of conventional concrete, with a compressive strength no less than 3,000 pounds per square inch, around the culverts below their springline. section 30 00 01.00 25 page 3 msh sediment retention structure crest raise (4) culverts are anchored down to prevent flotation during concrete placement below the springline. (5) upon completion of the river diversion time period, completely fill all culverts installed within the rcc structure with concrete with compressive strength of no less than 3,000 pounds per square inch. c. the existing outlet works pipes may not be used for river diversion. river diversion must occur within the existing spillway channel. d. cofferdams must be designed by a licensed professional engineer in the state of washington. cofferdams must be designed according to usace manuals and regulations cited in the paragraph references. submit cofferdam design for review. submit at least 30 days prior to iww for review. include all relevant sketches, shop drawings, and calculations packages. designs must be peer reviewed by an independent technical reviewer with supporting documentation of that review provided in the package. cofferdams designed and constructed as part of temporary works must have any features not consisting of earth materials removed from the spillway and sediment plain. 3.2 seepage consider the potential for seepage through cofferdams and through the rock foundation beneath cofferdams. design the river diversion system to prevent potential seepage from disrupting construction activities, by minimizing or collecting such potential seepage. 3.3 minimum discharge for river continuity during transitions in river diversions, maintain a minimum discharge of 50 cubic feet per second of the north fork toutle river from the upstream reservoir to the downstream channel. the location of the discharge along the existing spillway crest may vary during construction. measure the discharge in the north fork toutle river at the usgs gage 14240525 located at the fish collection facility downstream of the sediment retention structure. pumping water for river diversion is not allowed in order to protect any fish that may be migrating downstream while the river diversion system is in place. during this minimum discharge, the number of culvert pipes may need to be limited to assure minimum depth criteria (next paragraph) is met. 3.4 minimum flow depth except for transitions described above, maintain a discharge of 340 cfs and a minimum flow depth of one foot to provide passage for any fish that may be migrating downstream while the contractor's river diversion system is in place. a siphon is an acceptable method to pass fish and water. contractor may cut slots through the rcc baffles of the first raise for pipe access. the combination of number and size of pipes must not cause the flow depths to run below minimum depth in the pipes at the median discharge 340 cfs during construction season. 3.5 diversion connectivity to existing low flow channel the river flows down the existing seven foot rcc crest raise wedge to the existing excavated low channel. no flow must be diverted southwest of the section 30 00 01.00 25 page 4 msh sediment retention structure crest raise dashed line (i.e. no diversion area) shown on the contract drawings (c-007). any means of piping, channeling, or berm is acceptable as long as there is no stranding of the fish. clearance of woody vegetation along the conveyance route is required. 3.6 fish rescue provide fisheries biologists or biological technicians during construction of the coffer dam and river division to rescue and relocate any stranded fish. any stranded fish will be rescued immediately and returned directly back into the river. 3.7 demobilization prior to demobilization from the site, all man-made components of the river diversion system must be removed and must remain the property of the contractor. earth materials used in cofferdams may remain in place, however, cofferdam material above the elevation of the crest of the low flow channel must be removed. -- end of

activities required for this contract must include, but not be limited to, the following: (1) excavation and removal of alluvial sediments on the existing bedrock surface of the spillway. additional specifications for alluvial sediment removal are provided in section 31 60 00.00 25, foundation preparation. (2) excavation and placement of alluvial sediments immediately upstream of the existing bedrock spillway to construct temporary low flow channels for care and diversion of the river flows. additional specifications for river diversion are provided in section 30 00 01.00 25, river diversion. (3) excavation of bedrock for the plunge pool. the excavated rock must be stockpiled in designated areas illustrated on the plans provided. (4) locally sourced cohesionless materials may be used for subgrade materials to the apron constructed along the permanent access road, otherwise imported materials meeting specifications may also be used. b. care and diversion of the river are not covered under this section. specifications for river diversion activities are provided in section 30 00 01.00 25, river diversion. 1.2 existing foundation exploration information and spillway survey data see section 31 60 00.00 25, foundation preparation, for existing foundation exploration information. in addition, the informational drawings include as-constructed drawings from the 1997 spillway erosion repair contract, including survey data of the existing spillway. for the basalt rock, the average uniaxial compressive strength is 20,000 pounds per square inch and the seismic p-wave velocity ranges from 11,500 to 15,000 feet per second. contractor may use p-wave velocity to correlate rip-ability of rock excavation equipment. 1.3 definitions 1.3.1 alluvial soils soils pertaining to or composed of alluvium, or deposited by a stream or running water. 1.3.2 hard materials weathered rock, dense consolidated deposits, or conglomerate materials section 31 23 00.00 25 page 2 msh sediment retention structure crest raise which are not included in the definition of "rock" but which usually require the use of heavy excavation equipment, ripper teeth, or jack hammers for removal. blasting was not required for the first spillway raise and we do not expect the need for blasting the plunge pool excavation for the second raise. 1.3.3 rock solid homogeneous interlocking crystalline material with firmly cemented, laminated, or foliated masses or conglomerate deposits, none of which can be removed without use of backhoe-mounted pneumatic hole punchers or rock breakers. the rock conditions expected to be encountered are described in the boring logs attached. 1.4 delivery, storage, and handling perform in a

foundation report first raise. 1.6 definitions 1.6.1 foundations the rock foundation is comprised of the rock surfaces and concrete filled joints, upon which the rcc layers must be placed. vertical surfaces, where permitted or required by these specifications, are included. 1.6.2 rock joints a. rock joints are all planar or curvilinear fractures, including cracks, crevices, and seams which separate a rock mass into individual rock blocks of various sizes. they may be open or closed and may be filled with material other than rock material. b. it is anticipated that a joint filled with concrete must effectively act as a leveling course in localized areas and facilitate placing the rcc. the joint filling is not intended to cutoff all seepage. c. there may be a requirement to overexcavate the rock surface (1h:1v) exposed by excavation between the plunge pool and the toe of the rcc structure. the contracting officer (co) or their designate will perform an inspection of the rock surface and determine if the exposed jointing requires the additional excavation. the requirements for overexcavation are specified below in paragraph foundation excavation. d. width, depth and the weathering conditions of existing rock joint conditions are unknown. rock conditions are determined by rock type, degree of weathering, and the method of rock excavation. previous crest raise work did not encounter rock that required removal and replacement with dental concrete. descriptions of foundation rock and quality are provided in the 2012 report which includes an annotated plan sheet with field mapped geologic conditions. 1.6.3 baseline conditions geotechnical boring logs are provided with the informational drawings. the foundation conditions encountered are expected to be similar to that described in the borings and that documented in the first spillway raise. see attached foundation report first raise (for information only). a. massive flow breccias b. highly fractured basalt

jet must consist of a one inch nozzle with a supply hose connected to a suitable source of water. the system must be capable of delivering up to 200 gpm. the flow rate must be controllable at the nozzle. part 3 execution 3.1 examination the limits of the proposed foundation treatment are approximately as indicated by the outline on the contract drawings. the co reserves the right to change the depth to, or the width of, the foundations if conditions exposed in the foundation excavations warrant such modifications. 3.2 preliminary cleanup when the co determines that satisfactory foundation joint cleaning has been reached, the co may direct that a preliminary cleanup be performed on all or any part of the rock foundation surface. this cleanup will consist of section 31 60 00.00 25 page 4 msh sediment retention structure crest raise removing all debris, loose rock, sand, silt, and other objectionable material by hand tools followed by water jets or any combination of additional methods approved or directed. the co may require that the excavation be continued and the preliminary cleanup procedure repeated until a satisfactory foundation surface is reached. for example, in areas where the excavation to grade line exposes fragmented rock with more than 50 percent sediment as described in paragraph baseline conditions item (d), immediately notify the co for guidance on continued excavation and replacement with rcc. 3.3 final cleanup and foundation preparation unless otherwise directed, final cleanup and foundation preparation must be performed on the spillway surface. this work must consist of removing loose rock and pockets of fines, sand, rock rubble or gravel and other objectionable material from the in place rock surface including areas of depression, large crevices, and open rock joints. the loose material need not be removed where the width of the opening is less than 0.5 inches. mechanical equipment may be used. picking, barring, and hand excavation may be necessary to obtain a foundation surface free from loose, drummy, or shattered materials. the final rock surface must be thoroughly cleaned by use of jets or other approved method and must be maintained in a clean condition until the placement of concrete thereon. the final rock surface must fall into one of the top three categories of expected base line condition see paragraph baseline conditions items (a), (b), or (c). the last category item (d) is unacceptable. upon completion of final clean up the, complete a topographic survey of the rock surface as specified in sections 01 71 23.16 25, construction surveying, and 01 78 39.10 25 as-built drawings. 3.4 dental treatment 3.4.1 general a. dental treatment consists of excavation, if necessary, of the material in joints, cavities, depressions, and the placement of concrete such that the final surface is satisfactory for the subsequent placement of rcc. the dental concrete mix design must have a low enough slump to penetrate into the minimum width joints - see below. b. the minimum width of joint excavation is 0.5 inches. joints and cavities must be excavated to a depth three times the width, measured at the base of the excavation, of the joint or cavity. a minimum cure time of 12 hours on the concrete is required. 3.4.2 dental concrete concrete must be used to fill joints, cavities, and depressions. prior to placement, the surfaces of the joint, cavity, and depression must be thoroughly cleaned using jets. the maximum aggregate size in the concrete must be 0.19 inch, or captured on a no. 10 sieve. the concrete must conform with paragraph materials. 3.5 tests establish and maintain quality control for foundation preparation operations to assure compliance with contract specifications and maintain records of the quality control for all operations including but not limited to the following: section 31 60 00.00 25 page 5 msh sediment retention structure crest raise 3.5.1 foundation excavation a. strict adherence to foundation excavation limits and depths will be required. b. the co will inspect the excavation for the plunge pool. based upon that inspection, the co may direct overexcavation of the upstream face of the plunge pool. the excavation the 2:1 slopes must be 8 feet wide measured perpendicular to the face of the of the plunge pool. the length of the excavation parallel to the plunge pool face will be determined by the co during the excavation, otherwise the rcc must be a minimum of 2 feet thick. c. the overexcavated portion of the plunge pool will be replaced with concrete according to the specifications outlined in section 03 37 23.00 25, roller-compacted concrete for mass concrete construction. 3.5.2 reports submit three copies of these records of inspection for excavation as well as corrective action taken daily. 3.6 foundation inspection and geologic mapping inspections to determine adequacy of the foundations will be performed by the co in all foundation areas between completion of excavation and placement of dental concrete. cooperate to the extent necessary to assist in inspection and mapping activities which may require additional survey control points and access. provide a minimum of 30 days advanced notice to the co prior to the foundation excavation and preliminary cleanup to ensure that personnel who will perform the foundation inspection and geologic foundation mapping are available to work onsite. coordinate the schedule for foundation excavation and preliminary cleanup with the co to ensure that the cleanup, inspection, and mapping proceed in an orderly manner. -- end of section -- section 31 60 00.00 25 page 6 submittal form,jan 96 previous edition is obsolete page 1 of 6 pages msh sediment retention

(section 10) 3. maintenance. (a) the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of any previously authorized, currently serviceable structure, or fill, or of any currently serviceable structure or fill authorized by 33 cfr 330.3, provided that the structure or fill is not to be put to uses differing from those uses specified or contemplated for it in the original permit or the most recently authorized modification. minor deviations in the structure's configuration or filled area, including those due to changes in materials, construction techniques, requirements of other regulatory agencies, or current construction codes or safety standards that are necessary to make the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement are authorized. any stream channel modification is limited to the minimum necessary for the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of the structure or fill; such modifications, including the removal of material from the stream channel, must be immediately adjacent to the project or within the boundaries of the structure or fill. this nwp also authorizes the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of those structures or fills destroyed or damaged by storms, floods, fire or other discrete events, provided the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement is commenced, or is under contract to commence, within two years of the date of their destruction or damage. in cases of catastrophic events, such as hurricanes or tornadoes, this two-year limit may be waived by the district engineer, provided the permittee can demonstrate funding, contract, or other similar delays. (b) this nwp also authorizes the removal of accumulated sediments and debris in the vicinity of existing structures (e.g., bridges, culverted road crossings, water intake structures, etc.) and/or the placement of new or additional riprap to protect the structure. the removal of sediment is limited to the minimum necessary to restore the waterway in the vicinity of the structure to the approximate dimensions that existed when the structure was built, but cannot extend farther than 200 feet in any direction from the structure. this 200 foot limit does not apply to maintenance dredging to remove accumulated sediments blocking or restricting outfall and intake structures or to maintenance dredging to remove accumulated sediments from canals associated with outfall and intake structures. all dredged or excavated materials must be deposited and retained in an area that has no waters of the united states unless otherwise specifically approved by the district engineer under separate authorization. the placement of new or additional riprap must be the minimum necessary to protect the structure or to ensure the safety of the structure. any bank stabilization measures not directly associated with the structure will require a separate authorization from the district engineer. (c) this nwp also authorizes temporary structures, fills, and work necessary to conduct the maintenance activity. appropriate measures must be taken to maintain normal downstream flows and minimize flooding to the maximum extent practicable, when temporary structures, work, and discharges, including cofferdams, are necessary for construction activities, access fills, a5-6 5 or dewatering of construction sites. temporary fills must consist of materials, and be placed in a manner, that will not be eroded by expected high flows. temporary fills must be removed in their entirety and the affected areas returned to pre-construction elevations. the areas affected by temporary fills must be revegetated, as appropriate. (d) this nwp does not authorize maintenance dredging for the primary purpose of navigation. this nwp does not authorize beach restoration. this nwp does not authorize new stream channelization or stream relocation projects. notification: for activities authorized by paragraph (b) of this nwp, the permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity (see general condition 31). the pre-construction notification must include information regarding the original design capacities and configurations of the outfalls, intakes, small impoundments, and canals. (sections 10 and 404) note: this nwp authorizes the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of any previously authorized structure or fill that does not qualify for the clean water act section 404(f) exemption for maintenance. 4. fish and wildlife harvesting, enhancement, and attraction devices and activities. fish and wildlife harvesting devices and activities such as pound nets, crab traps, crab dredging, eel pots, lobster traps, duck blinds, and clam and oyster digging, fish aggregating devices, and small fish attraction devices such as open water fish concentrators (sea kites, etc.). this nwp does not authorize artificial reefs or impoundments and semi-impoundments of waters of the united states for the culture or holding of motile species such as lobster, or the use of covered oyster trays or clam racks. (sections 10 and 404) 5. scientific measurement devices. devices, whose purpose is to measure and record scientific data, such as staff gages, tide and current gages, meteorological stations, water recording and biological observation devices, water quality testing and improvement devices, and similar structures. small weirs and flumes constructed primarily to record water quantity and velocity are also authorized provided the discharge is limited to 25 cubic yards. upon completion of the use of the device to measure and record scientific data, the measuring device and any other structures or fills associated with that device (e.g., foundations, anchors, buoys, lines, etc.) must be removed to the maximum extent practicable and the site restored to preconstruction elevations. (sections 10 and 404) 6. survey activities. survey activities, such as core sampling, seismic exploratory operations, plugging of seismic shot holes and other exploratory-type bore holes, exploratory trenching, soil surveys, sampling, sample plots or transects for wetland delineations, and historic resources surveys. for the purposes of this nwp, the term exploratory trenching means mechanical land clearing of the upper soil profile to expose bedrock or substrate, for the purpose of mapping or sampling the exposed material. the area in which the exploratory trench is dug must be restored to its pre-construction elevation upon completion of the work and must not drain a water of the united states. in wetlands, the top 6 to 12 inches of the trench should normally be backfilled with topsoil from the trench. this nwp authorizes the construction of temporary pads, provided the discharge does not exceed 1/10-acre in waters of the u.s. discharges and structures associated with the recovery of historic resources are not authorized by this nwp. drilling and the discharge of excavated material from test wells for oil and gas a5-7 6 exploration are not authorized by this nwp; the plugging of such wells is authorized. fill placed for roads and other similar activities is not authorized by this nwp. the nwp does not authorize any permanent structures. the discharge of drilling mud and cuttings may require a permit under section 402 of the clean water act. (sections 10 and 404) 7. outfall structures and associated intake structures. activities related to the construction or modification of outfall structures and associated intake structures, where the effluent from the outfall is authorized, conditionally authorized, or specifically exempted by, or otherwise in compliance with regulations issued under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program (section 402 of the clean water act). the construction of intake structures is not authorized by this nwp, unless they are directly associated with an authorized outfall structure. notification: the permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity. (see general condition 31.) (sections 10 and 404) 8. oil and gas structures on the outer continental shelf. structures for the exploration, production, and transportation of oil, gas, and minerals on the outer continental shelf within areas leased for such purposes by the department of the interior, bureau of ocean energy management. such structures shall not be placed within the limits of any designated shipping safety fairway or traffic separation scheme, except temporary anchors that comply with the fairway regulations in 33 cfr 322.5(l). the district engineer will review such proposals to ensure compliance with the provisions of the fairway regulations in 33 cfr 322.5(l). any corps review under this nwp will be limited to the effects on navigation and national security in accordance with 33 cfr 322.5(f), as well as 33 cfr 322.5(l) and 33 cfr part 334. such structures will not be placed in established danger zones or restricted areas as designated in 33 cfr part 334, nor will such structures be permitted in epa or corps designated dredged material disposal areas. notification: the permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity. (see general condition 31.) (section 10) 9. structures in fleeting and anchorage areas. structures, buoys, floats and other devices placed within anchorage or fleeting areas to facilitate moorage of vessels where the u.s. coast guard has established such areas for that purpose.

(section 10) 11. temporary recreational structures. temporary buoys, markers, small floating docks, and similar structures placed for recreational use during specific events such as water skiing competitions and boat races or seasonal use, provided that such structures are removed within 30 days after use has been discontinued. at corps of engineers reservoirs, the reservoir manager must approve each buoy or marker individually. (section 10) 12. utility line activities. activities required for the construction, maintenance, repair, and removal of utility lines and associated facilities in waters of the united states, provided the activity does not result in the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of waters of the united states for each single and complete project. a5-8 7 utility lines: this nwp authorizes the construction, maintenance, or repair of utility lines, including outfall and intake structures, and the associated excavation, backfill, or bedding for the utility lines, in all waters of the united states, provided there is no change in preconstruction contours. a utility line is defined as any pipe or pipeline for the transportation of any gaseous, liquid, liquescent, or slurry substance, for any purpose, and any cable, line, or wire for the transmission for any purpose of electrical energy, telephone, and telegraph messages, and radio and television communication. the term utility line does not include activities that drain a water of the united states, such as drainage tile or french drains, but it does apply to pipes conveying drainage from another area. material resulting from trench excavation may be temporarily sidecast into waters of the united states for no more than three months, provided the material is not placed in such a manner that it is dispersed by currents or other forces. the district engineer may extend the period of temporary side casting for no more than a total of 180 days, where appropriate. in wetlands, the top 6 to 12 inches of the trench should normally be backfilled with topsoil from the trench. the trench cannot be constructed or backfilled in such a manner as to drain waters of the united states (e.g., backfilling with extensive gravel layers, creating a french drain effect). any exposed slopes and stream banks must be stabilized immediately upon completion of the utility line crossing of each waterbody. utility line substations: this nwp authorizes the construction, maintenance, or expansion of substation facilities associated with a power line or utility line in non-tidal waters of the united states, provided the activity, in combination with all other activities included in one single and complete project, does not result in the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of waters of the united states. this nwp does not authorize discharges into non-tidal wetlands adjacent to tidal waters of the united states to construct, maintain, or expand substation facilities. foundations for overhead utility line towers, poles, and anchors: this nwp authorizes the construction or maintenance of foundations for overhead utility line towers, poles, and anchors in all waters of the united states, provided the foundations are the minimum size necessary and separate footings for each tower leg (rather than a larger single pad) are used where feasible. access roads: this nwp authorizes the construction of access roads for the construction and maintenance of utility lines, including overhead power lines and utility line substations, in non-tidal waters of the united states, provided the activity, in combination with all other activities included in one single and complete project, does not cause the loss of greater than 1/2- acre of non-tidal waters of the united states. this nwp does not authorize discharges into nontidal wetlands adjacent to tidal waters for access roads. access roads must be the minimum width necessary (see note 2, below). access roads must be constructed so that the length of the road minimizes any adverse effects on waters of the united states and must be as near as possible to pre-construction contours and elevations (e.g., at grade corduroy roads or geotextile/gravel roads). access roads constructed above pre-construction contours and elevations in waters of the united states must be properly bridged or culverted to maintain surface flows. this nwp may authorize utility lines in or affecting navigable waters of the united states even if there is no associated discharge of dredged or fill material (see 33 cfr part 322). overhead utility lines constructed over section 10 waters and utility lines that are routed in or under section 10 waters without a discharge of dredged or fill material require a section 10 permit. a5-9 8 this nwp also authorizes temporary structures, fills, and work necessary to conduct the utility line activity. appropriate measures must be taken to maintain normal downstream flows and minimize flooding to the maximum extent practicable, when temporary structures, work, and discharges, including cofferdams, are necessary for construction activities, access fills, or dewatering of construction sites. temporary fills must consist of materials, and be placed in a manner, that will not be eroded by expected high flows. temporary fills must be removed in their entirety and the affected areas returned to pre-construction elevations. the areas affected by temporary fills must be revegetated, as appropriate. notification: the permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity if any of the following criteria are met: (1) the activity involves mechanized land clearing in a forested wetland for the utility line right-of-way; (2) a section 10 permit is required; (3) the utility line in waters of the united states, excluding overhead lines, exceeds 500 feet; (4) the utility line is placed within a jurisdictional area (i.e., water of the united states), and it runs parallel to or along a stream bed that is within that jurisdictional area; (5) discharges that result in the loss of greater than 1/10-acre of waters of the united states; (6) permanent access roads are constructed above grade in waters of the united states for a distance of more than 500 feet; or (7) permanent access roads are constructed in waters of the united states with impervious materials. (see general condition 31.) (sections 10 and 404) note 1: where the proposed utility line is constructed or installed in navigable waters of the united states (i.e., section 10 waters) within the coastal united states, the great lakes, and united states territories, copies of the pre-construction notification and nwp verification will be sent by the corps to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa), national ocean service (nos), for charting the utility line to protect navigation. note 2: access roads used for both construction and maintenance may be authorized, provided they meet the terms and conditions of this nwp. access roads used solely for construction of the utility line must be removed upon completion of the work, in accordance with the requirements for temporary fills. note 3: pipes or pipelines used to transport gaseous, liquid, liquescent, or slurry substances over navigable waters of the united states are considered to be bridges, not utility lines, and may require a permit from the u.s. coast guard pursuant to section 9 of the rivers and harbors act of 1899. however, any discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the united states associated with such pipelines will require a section 404 permit (see nwp 15). note 4: for overhead utility lines authorized by this nwp, a copy of the pcn and nwp verification will be provided to the department of defense siting clearinghouse, which will evaluate potential effects on military activities. 13. bank stabilization. bank stabilization activities necessary for erosion prevention, provided the activity meets all of the following criteria: (a) no material is placed in excess of the minimum needed for erosion protection; (b) the activity is no more than 500 feet in length along the bank, unless the district engineer waives this criterion by making a written determination concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse effects; (c) the activity will not exceed an average of one cubic yard per running foot placed along the bank below the plane of the ordinary high water mark or the high tide line, unless the a5-10 9 district engineer waives this criterion by making a written determination concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse effects; (d) the activity does not involve discharges of dredged or fill material into special aquatic sites, unless the district engineer waives this criterion by making a written determination concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse effects; (e) no material is of a type, or is placed in any location, or in any manner, that will impair surface water flow into or out of any waters of the united states; (f) no material is placed in a manner that will be eroded by normal or expected high flows (properly anchored trees and treetops may be used in low energy areas); and, (g) the activity is not a stream channelization activity. this nwp also authorizes temporary structures, fills, and work necessary to construct the bank stabilization activity. appropriate measures must be taken to maintain normal downstream flows and minimize flooding to the maximum extent practicable, when temporary structures, work, and discharges, including cofferdams, are necessary for construction activities, access fills, or dewatering of construction sites. temporary fills must consist of materials, and be placed in a manner, that will not be eroded by expected high flows. temporary fills must be removed in their entirety and the affected areas returned to pre-construction elevations. the areas affected by temporary fills must be revegetated, as appropriate. invasive plant species shall not be used for bioengineering or vegetative bank stabilization. notification: the permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity if the bank stabilization activity: (1) involves discharges into special aquatic sites; or (2) is in excess of 500 feet in length; or (3) will involve the discharge of greater than an average of one cubic yard per running foot along the bank below the plane of the ordinary high water mark or the high tide line. (see general condition 31.) (sections 10 and 404) 14. linear transportation projects. activities required for the construction, expansion, modification, or improvement of linear transportation projects (e.g., roads, highways, railways, trails, airport runways, and taxiways) in waters of the united states. for linear transportation projects in non-tidal waters, the discharge cannot cause the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of waters of the united states. for linear transportation projects in tidal waters, the discharge cannot cause the loss of greater than 1/3-acre of waters of the united states. any stream channel modification, including bank stabilization, is limited to the minimum necessary to construct or protect the linear transportation project; such modifications must be in the immediate vicinity of the project. this nwp also authorizes temporary structures, fills, and work necessary to construct the linear transportation project. appropriate measures must be taken to maintain normal downstream flows and minimize flooding to the maximum extent practicable, when temporary structures, work, and discharges, including cofferdams, are necessary for construction activities, access fills, or dewatering of construction sites. temporary fills must consist of materials, and be placed in a manner, that will not be eroded by expected high flows. temporary fills must be removed in their entirety and the affected areas returned to pre-construction elevations. the areas affected by temporary fills must be revegetated, as appropriate. this nwp cannot be used to authorize non-linear features commonly associated with transportation projects, such as vehicle maintenance or storage buildings, parking lots, train stations, or aircraft hangars. a5-11 10 notification: the permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity if: (1) the loss of waters of the united states exceeds 1/10-acre; or (2) there is a discharge in a special aquatic site, including wetlands. (see general condition 31.) (sections 10 and 404) note: some discharges for the construction of farm roads or forest roads, or temporary roads for moving mining equipment, may qualify for an exemption under section 404(f) of the clean water act (see 33 cfr 323.4). 15. u.s. coast guard approved bridges. discharges of dredged or fill material incidental to the construction of a bridge across navigable waters of the united states, including cofferdams, abutments, foundation seals, piers, and temporary construction and access fills, provided the construction of the bridge structure has been authorized by the u.s. coast guard under section 9 of the rivers and harbors act of 1899 and other applicable laws. causeways and approach fills are not included in this nwp and will require a separate section 404 permit. (section 404) 16. return water from upland contained disposal areas. return water from an upland contained dredged material disposal area. the return water from a contained disposal area is administratively defined as a discharge of dredged material by 33 cfr 323.2(d), even though the disposal itself occurs in an area that has no waters of the united states and does not require a section 404 permit. this nwp satisfies the technical requirement for a section 404 permit for the return water where the quality of the return water is controlled by the state through the section 401 certification procedures. the dredging activity may require a section 404 permit (33 cfr 323.2(d)), and will require a section 10 permit if located in navigable waters of the united states. (section 404) 17. hydropower projects. discharges of dredged or fill material associated with hydropower projects having: (a) less than 5000 kw of total generating capacity at existing reservoirs, where the project, including the fill, is licensed by the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) under the federal power act of 1920, as amended; or (b) a licensing exemption granted by the ferc pursuant to section 408 of the energy security act of 1980 (16 u.s.c. 2705 and 2708) and section 30 of the federal power act, as amended. notification: the permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity. (see general condition 31.) (section 404) 18. minor discharges. minor discharges of dredged or fill material into all waters of the united states, provided the activity meets all of the following criteria: (a) the quantity of discharged material and the volume of area excavated do not exceed 25 cubic yards below the plane of the ordinary high water mark or the high tide line; (b) the discharge will not cause the loss of more than 1/10-acre of waters of the united states; and (c) the discharge is not placed for the purpose of a stream diversion. notification: the permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity if: (1) the discharge or the volume of area excavated exceeds 10 cubic yards below the plane of the ordinary high water mark or the high tide line, or a5-12 11 (2) the discharge is in a special aquatic site, including wetlands.

(see general condition 31.) if condition 1 above is triggered, the permittee cannot commence the activity until informed by the district engineer that compliance with the historic properties general condition is completed. (sections 10 and 404) note 1: if a removed vessel is disposed of in waters of the united states, a permit from the u.s. epa may be required (see 40 cfr 229.3). if a department of the army permit is required for vessel disposal in waters of the united states, separate authorization will be required. note 2: compliance with general condition 18, endangered species, and general condition 20, historic properties, is required for all nwps. the concern with historic properties is emphasized in the notification requirements for this nwp because of the likelihood that submerged vessels may be historic properties. 23. approved categorical exclusions. activities undertaken, assisted, authorized, regulated, funded, or financed, in whole or in part, by another federal agency or department where: a5-14 13 (a) that agency or department has determined, pursuant to the council on environmental quality's implementing regulations for the national environmental policy act (40 cfr part 1500 et seq.), that the activity is categorically excluded from environmental documentation, because it is included within a category of actions which neither individually nor cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment; and (b) the office of the chief of engineers (attn: cecw-co) has concurred with that agency s or department s determination that the activity is categorically excluded and approved the activity for authorization under nwp 23. the office of the chief of engineers may require additional conditions, including preconstruction notification, for authorization of an agency s categorical exclusions under this nwp. notification: certain categorical exclusions approved for authorization under this nwp require the permittee to submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity (see general condition 31). the activities that require pre-construction notification are listed in the appropriate regulatory guidance letters. (sections 10 and 404) note: the agency or department may submit an application for an activity believed to be categorically excluded to the office of the chief of engineers (attn: cecw-co). prior to approval for authorization under this nwp of any agency's activity, the office of the chief of engineers will solicit public comment. as of the date of issuance of this nwp, agencies with approved categorical exclusions are the: bureau of reclamation, federal highway administration, and u.s. coast guard. activities approved for authorization under this nwp as of the date of this notice are found in corps regulatory guidance letter 05-07, which is available at: http://www.usace.army.mil/missions/civilworks/regulatoryprogramandpermits/guidanceletter s.aspx . any future approved categorical exclusions will be announced in regulatory guidance letters and posted on this same web site. 24. indian tribe or state administered section 404 programs. any activity permitted by a state or indian tribe administering its own section 404 permit program pursuant to 33 u.s.c. 1344(g)-(l) is permitted pursuant to section 10 of the rivers and harbors act of 1899. (section 10) note 1: as of the date of the promulgation of this nwp, only new jersey and michigan administer their own section 404 permit programs. note 2: those activities that do not involve an indian tribe or state section 404 permit are not included in this nwp, but certain structures will be exempted by section 154 of pub. l. 94-587, 90 stat. 2917 (33 u.s.c. 591) (see 33 cfr 322.4(b)). 25. structural discharges. discharges of material such as concrete, sand, rock, etc., into tightly sealed forms or cells where the material will be used as a structural member for standard pile supported structures, such as bridges, transmission line footings, and walkways, or for general navigation, such as mooring cells, including the excavation of bottom material from within the form prior to the discharge of concrete, sand, rock, etc. this nwp does not authorize filled structural members that would support buildings, building pads, homes, house pads, parking areas, storage areas and other such structures. the structure itself may require a separate section 10 permit if located in navigable waters of the united states. (section 404) a5-15 14 26. [reserved] 27. aquatic habitat restoration, establishment, and enhancement activities. activities in waters of the united states associated with the restoration, enhancement, and establishment of tidal and non-tidal wetlands and riparian areas, the restoration and enhancement of non-tidal streams and other non-tidal open waters, and the rehabilitation or enhancement of tidal streams, tidal wetlands, and tidal open waters, provided those activities result in net increases in aquatic resource functions and services. to the extent that a corps permit is required, activities authorized by this nwp include, but are not limited to: the removal of accumulated sediments; the installation, removal, and maintenance of small water control structures, dikes, and berms, as well as discharges of dredged or fill material to restore appropriate stream channel configurations after small water control structures, dikes, and berms, are removed; the installation of current deflectors; the enhancement, restoration, or establishment of riffle and pool stream structure; the placement of in-stream habitat structures; modifications of the stream bed and/or banks to restore or establish stream meanders; the backfilling of artificial channels; the removal of existing drainage structures, such as drain tiles, and the filling, blocking, or reshaping of drainage ditches to restore wetland hydrology; the installation of structures or fills necessary to establish or re-establish wetland or stream hydrology; the construction of small nesting islands; the construction of open water areas; the construction of oyster habitat over unvegetated bottom in tidal waters; shellfish seeding; activities needed to reestablish vegetation, including plowing or discing for seed bed preparation and the planting of appropriate wetland species; re-establishment of submerged aquatic vegetation in areas where those plant communities previously existed; re-establishment of tidal wetlands in tidal waters where those wetlands previously existed; mechanized land clearing to remove non-native invasive, exotic, or nuisance vegetation; and other related activities. only native plant species should be planted at the site. this nwp authorizes the relocation of non-tidal waters, including non-tidal wetlands and streams, on the project site provided there are net increases in aquatic resource functions and services. except for the relocation of non-tidal waters on the project site, this nwp does not authorize the conversion of a stream or natural wetlands to another aquatic habitat type (e.g., stream to wetland or vice versa) or uplands. changes in wetland plant communities that occur when wetland hydrology is more fully restored during wetland rehabilitation activities are not considered a conversion to another aquatic habitat type. this nwp does not authorize stream channelization. this nwp does not authorize the relocation of tidal waters or the conversion of tidal waters, including tidal wetlands, to other aquatic uses, such as the conversion of tidal wetlands into open water impoundments. compensatory mitigation is not required for activities authorized by this nwp since these activities must result in net increases in aquatic resource functions and services. reversion. for enhancement, restoration, and establishment activities conducted: (1) in accordance with the terms and conditions of a binding stream or wetland enhancement or restoration agreement, or a wetland establishment agreement, between the landowner and the u.s. fish and wildlife service (fws), the natural resources conservation service (nrcs), the farm service agency (fsa), the national marine fisheries service (nmfs), the national ocean service (nos), u.s. forest service (usfs), or their designated state cooperating agencies; (2) as voluntary wetland restoration, enhancement, and establishment actions documented by the a5-16 15 nrcs or usda technical service provider pursuant to nrcs field office technical guide standards; or (3) on reclaimed surface coal mine lands, in accordance with a surface mining control and reclamation act permit issued by the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement (osmre) or the applicable state agency, this nwp also authorizes any future discharge of dredged or fill material associated with the reversion of the area to its documented prior condition and use (i.e., prior to the restoration, enhancement, or establishment activities). the reversion must occur within five years after expiration of a limited term wetland restoration or establishment agreement or permit, and is authorized in these circumstances even if the discharge occurs after this nwp expires. the five-year reversion limit does not apply to agreements without time limits reached between the landowner and the fws, nrcs, fsa, nmfs, nos, usfs, or an appropriate state cooperating agency. this nwp also authorizes discharges of dredged or fill material in waters of the united states for the reversion of wetlands that were restored, enhanced, or established on prior-converted cropland or on uplands, in accordance with a binding agreement between the landowner and nrcs, fsa, fws, or their designated state cooperating agencies (even though the restoration, enhancement, or establishment activity did not require a section 404 permit). the prior condition will be documented in the original agreement or permit, and the determination of return to prior conditions will be made by the federal agency or appropriate state agency executing the agreement or permit. before conducting any reversion activity the permittee or the appropriate federal or state agency must notify the district engineer and include the documentation of the prior condition. once an area has reverted to its prior physical condition, it will be subject to whatever the corps regulatory requirements are applicable to that type of land at the time. the requirement that the activity results in a net increase in aquatic resource functions and services does not apply to reversion activities meeting the above conditions. except for the activities described above, this nwp does not authorize any future discharge of dredged or fill material associated with the reversion of the area to its prior condition. in such cases a separate permit would be required for any reversion. reporting. for those activities that do not require pre-construction notification, the permittee must submit to the district engineer a copy of: (1) the binding stream enhancement or restoration agreement or wetland enhancement, restoration, or establishment agreement, or a project description, including project plans and location map; (2) the nrcs or usda technical service provider documentation for the voluntary stream enhancement or restoration action or wetland restoration, enhancement, or establishment action; or (3) the smcra permit issued by osmre or the applicable state agency. the report must also include information on baseline ecological conditions on the project site, such as a delineation of wetlands, streams, and/or other aquatic habitats. these documents must be submitted to the district engineer at least 30 days prior to commencing activities in waters of the united states authorized by this nwp. notification: the permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing any activity (see general condition 31), except for the following activities: (1) activities conducted on non-federal public lands and private lands, in accordance with the terms and conditions of a binding stream enhancement or restoration agreement or wetland enhancement, restoration, or establishment agreement between the landowner and the u.s. fws, nrcs, fsa, nmfs, nos, usfs or their designated state cooperating agencies; a5-17 16 (2) voluntary stream or wetland restoration or enhancement action, or wetland establishment action, documented by the nrcs or usda technical service provider pursuant to nrcs field office technical guide standards; or (3) the reclamation of surface coal mine lands, in accordance with an smcra permit issued by the osmre or the applicable state agency. however, the permittee must submit a copy of the appropriate documentation to the district engineer to fulfill the reporting requirement. (sections 10 and 404) note: this nwp can be used to authorize compensatory mitigation projects, including mitigation banks and in-lieu fee projects. however, this nwp does not authorize the reversion of an area used for a compensatory mitigation project to its prior condition, since compensatory mitigation is generally intended to be permanent. 28. modifications of existing marinas. reconfiguration of existing docking facilities within an authorized marina area. no dredging, additional slips, dock spaces, or expansion of any kind within waters of the united states is authorized by this nwp. (section 10) 29. residential developments. discharges of dredged or fill material into non-tidal waters of the united states for the construction or expansion of a single residence, a multiple unit residential development, or a residential subdivision. this nwp authorizes the construction of building foundations and building pads and attendant features that are necessary for the use of the residence or residential development. attendant features may include but are not limited to roads, parking lots, garages, yards, utility lines, storm water management facilities, septic fields, and recreation facilities such as playgrounds, playing fields, and golf courses (provided the golf course is an integral part of the residential development). the discharge must not cause the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of non-tidal waters of the united states, including the loss of no more than 300 linear feet of stream bed, unless for intermittent and ephemeral stream beds the district engineer waives the 300 linear foot limit by making a written determination concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse effects. this nwp does not authorize discharges into non-tidal wetlands adjacent to tidal waters. subdivisions: for residential subdivisions, the aggregate total loss of waters of united states authorized by this nwp cannot exceed 1/2-acre. this includes any loss of waters of the united states associated with development of individual subdivision lots. notification: the permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity. (see general condition 31.) (sections 10 and 404) 30. moist soil management for wildlife. discharges of dredged or fill material into nontidal waters of the united states and maintenance activities that are associated with moist soil management for wildlife for the purpose of continuing ongoing, site-specific, wildlife management activities where soil manipulation is used to manage habitat and feeding areas for wildlife. such activities include, but are not limited to, plowing or discing to impede succession, preparing seed beds, or establishing fire breaks. sufficient riparian areas must be maintained adjacent to all open water bodies, including streams, to preclude water quality degradation due to erosion and sedimentation. this nwp does not authorize the construction of new dikes, roads, water control structures, or similar features associated with the management areas. the activity must not result in a net loss of aquatic resource functions and services. this nwp does not a5-18 17 authorize the conversion of wetlands to uplands, impoundments, or other open water bodies. (section 404) note: the repair, maintenance, or replacement of existing water control structures or the repair or maintenance of dikes may be authorized by nwp 3. some such activities may qualify for an exemption under section 404(f) of the clean water act (see 33 cfr 323.4). 31. maintenance of existing flood control facilities. discharges of dredged or fill material resulting from activities associated with the maintenance of existing flood control facilities, including debris basins, retention/detention basins, levees, and channels that: (i) were previously authorized by the corps by individual permit, general permit, or 33 cfr 330.3, or did not require a permit at the time they were constructed, or (ii) were constructed by the corps and transferred to a non-federal sponsor for operation and maintenance. activities authorized by this nwp are limited to those resulting from maintenance activities that are conducted within the maintenance baseline, as described in the definition below. discharges of dredged or fill materials associated with maintenance activities in flood control facilities in any watercourse that have previously been determined to be within the maintenance baseline are authorized under this nwp. to the extent that a corps permit is required, this nwp authorizes the removal of vegetation from levees associated with the flood control project. this nwp does not authorize the removal of sediment and associated vegetation from natural water courses except when these activities have been included in the maintenance baseline. all dredged material must be placed in an area that has no waters of the united states or a separately authorized disposal site in waters of the united states, and proper siltation controls must be used. maintenance baseline: the maintenance baseline is a description of the physical characteristics (e.g., depth, width, length, location, configuration, or design flood capacity, etc.) of a flood control project within which maintenance activities are normally authorized by nwp 31, subject to any case-specific conditions required by the district engineer. the district engineer will approve the maintenance baseline based on the approved or constructed capacity of the flood control facility, whichever is smaller, including any areas where there are no constructed channels but which are part of the facility. the prospective permittee will provide documentation of the physical characteristics of the flood control facility (which will normally consist of as-built or approved drawings) and documentation of the approved and constructed design capacities of the flood control facility. if no evidence of the constructed capacity exists, the approved capacity will be used. the documentation will also include best management practices to ensure that the impacts to the aquatic environment are minimal, especially in maintenance areas where there are no constructed channels. (the corps may request maintenance records in areas where there has not been recent maintenance.) revocation or modification of the final determination of the maintenance baseline can only be done in accordance with 33 cfr 330.5. except in emergencies as described below, this nwp cannot be used until the district engineer approves the maintenance baseline and determines the need for mitigation and any regional or activity-specific conditions. once determined, the maintenance baseline will remain valid for any subsequent reissuance of this nwp. this nwp does not authorize maintenance of a flood control facility that has been abandoned. a flood control facility will be considered abandoned if it has operated at a significantly reduced capacity without needed maintenance being accomplished in a timely manner. mitigation: the district engineer will determine any required mitigation one-time only for impacts associated with maintenance work at the same time that the maintenance baseline is a5-19 18 approved. such one-time mitigation will be required when necessary to ensure that adverse environmental impacts are no more than minimal, both individually and cumulatively. such mitigation will only be required once for any specific reach of a flood control project. however, if one-time mitigation is required for impacts associated with maintenance activities, the district engineer will not delay needed maintenance, provided the district engineer and the permittee establish a schedule for identification, approval, development, construction and completion of any such required mitigation. once the one-time mitigation described above has been completed, or a determination made that mitigation is not required, no further mitigation will be required for maintenance activities within the maintenance baseline. in determining appropriate mitigation, the district engineer will give special consideration to natural water courses that have been included in the maintenance baseline and require compensatory mitigation and/or best management practices as appropriate. emergency situations: in emergency situations, this nwp may be used to authorize maintenance activities in flood control facilities for which no maintenance baseline has been approved. emergency situations are those which would result in an unacceptable hazard to life, a significant loss of property, or an immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship if action is not taken before a maintenance baseline can be approved. in such situations, the determination of mitigation requirements, if any, may be deferred until the emergency has been resolved. once the emergency has ended, a maintenance baseline must be established expeditiously, and mitigation, including mitigation for maintenance conducted during the emergency, must be required as appropriate. notification: the permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer before any maintenance work is conducted (see general condition 31). the preconstruction notification may be for activity-specific maintenance or for maintenance of the entire flood control facility by submitting a five-year (or less) maintenance plan. the preconstruction notification must include a description of the maintenance baseline and the dredged material disposal site. (sections 10 and 404) 32. completed enforcement actions. any structure, work, or discharge of dredged or fill material remaining in place or undertaken for mitigation, restoration, or environmental benefit in compliance with either: (i) the terms of a final written corps non-judicial settlement agreement resolving a violation of section 404 of the clean water act and/or section 10 of the rivers and harbors act of 1899; or the terms of an epa 309(a) order on consent resolving a violation of section 404 of the clean water act, provided that: (a) the unauthorized activity affected no more than 5 acres of non-tidal waters or 1 acre of tidal waters; (b) the settlement agreement provides for environmental benefits, to an equal or greater degree, than the environmental detriments caused by the unauthorized activity that is authorized by this nwp; and (c) the district engineer issues a verification letter authorizing the activity subject to the terms and conditions of this nwp and the settlement agreement, including a specified completion date; or (ii) the terms of a final federal court decision, consent decree, or settlement agreement resulting from an enforcement action brought by the united states under section 404 of the clean water act and/or section 10 of the rivers and harbors act of 1899; or a5-20 19 (iii) the terms of a final court decision, consent decree, settlement agreement, or nonjudicial settlement agreement resulting from a natural resource damage claim brought by a trustee or trustees for natural resources (as defined by the national contingency plan at 40 cfr subpart g) under section 311 of the clean water act, section 107 of the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, section 312 of the national marine sanctuaries act, section 1002 of the oil pollution act of 1990, or the park system resource protection act at 16 u.s.c. 19jj, to the extent that a corps permit is required. compliance is a condition of the nwp itself. any authorization under this nwp is automatically revoked if the permittee does not comply with the terms of this nwp or the terms of the court decision, consent decree, or judicial/non-judicial settlement agreement. this nwp does not apply to any activities occurring after the date of the decision, decree, or agreement that are not for the purpose of mitigation, restoration, or environmental benefit. before reaching any settlement agreement, the corps will ensure compliance with the provisions of 33 cfr part 326 and 33 cfr 330.6(d)(2) and (e). (sections 10 and 404) 33. temporary construction, access, and dewatering. temporary structures, work, and discharges, including cofferdams, necessary for construction activities or access fills or dewatering of construction sites, provided that the associated primary activity is authorized by the corps of engineers or the u.s. coast guard. this nwp also authorizes temporary structures, work, and discharges, including cofferdams, necessary for construction activities not otherwise subject to the corps or u.s. coast guard permit requirements. appropriate measures must be taken to maintain near normal downstream flows and to minimize flooding. fill must consist of materials, and be placed in a manner, that will not be eroded by expected high flows. the use of dredged material may be allowed if the district engineer determines that it will not cause more than minimal adverse effects on aquatic resources. following completion of construction, temporary fill must be entirely removed to an area that has no waters of the united states, dredged material must be returned to its original location, and the affected areas must be restored to pre-construction elevations. the affected areas must also be revegetated, as appropriate. this permit does not authorize the use of cofferdams to dewater wetlands or other aquatic areas to change their use. structures left in place after construction is completed require a separate section 10 permit if located in navigable waters of the united states. (see 33 cfr part 322.) notification: the permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity (see general condition 31). the pre-construction notification must include a restoration plan showing how all temporary fills and structures will be removed and the area restored to pre-project conditions. (sections 10 and 404) 34. cranberry production activities. discharges of dredged or fill material for dikes, berms, pumps, water control structures or leveling of cranberry beds associated with expansion, enhancement, or modification activities at existing cranberry production operations. the cumulative total acreage of disturbance per cranberry production operation, including but not limited to, filling, flooding, ditching, or clearing, must not exceed 10 acres of waters of the united states, including wetlands. the activity must not result in a net loss of wetland acreage. this nwp does not authorize any discharge of dredged or fill material related to other cranberry production activities such as warehouses, processing facilities, or parking areas. for the purposes of this nwp, the cumulative total of 10 acres will be measured over the period that this nwp is valid. a5-21 20 notification: the permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer once during the period that this nwp is valid, and the nwp will then authorize discharges of dredge or fill material at an existing operation for the permit term, provided the 10- acre limit is not exceeded. (see general condition 31.) (section 404) 35. maintenance dredging of existing basins. excavation and removal of accumulated sediment for maintenance of existing marina basins, access channels to marinas or boat slips, and boat slips to previously authorized depths or controlling depths for ingress/egress, whichever is less, provided the dredged material is deposited at an area that has no waters of the united states site and proper siltation controls are used. (section 10) 36. boat ramps. activities required for the construction of boat ramps, provided the activity meets all of the following criteria: (a) the discharge into waters of the united states does not exceed 50 cubic yards of concrete, rock, crushed stone or gravel into forms, or in the form of pre-cast concrete planks or slabs, unless the district engineer waives the 50 cubic yard limit by making a written determination concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse effects; (b) the boat ramp does not exceed 20 feet in width, unless the district engineer waives this criterion by making a written determination concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse effects; (c) the base material is crushed stone, gravel or other suitable material; (d) the excavation is limited to the area necessary for site preparation and all excavated material is removed to an area that has no waters of the united states; and, (e) no material is placed in special aquatic sites, including wetlands. the use of unsuitable material that is structurally unstable is not authorized. if dredging in navigable waters of the united states is necessary to provide access to the boat ramp, the dredging must be authorized by another nwp, a regional general permit, or an individual permit. notification: the permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity if: (1) the discharge into waters of the united states exceeds 50 cubic yards, or (2) the boat ramp exceeds 20 feet in width. (see general condition 31.) (sections 10 and 404) 37. emergency watershed protection and rehabilitation. work done by or funded by: (a) the natural resources conservation service for a situation requiring immediate action under its emergency watershed protection program (7 cfr part 624); (b) the u.s. forest service under its burned-area emergency rehabilitation handbook (fsh 2509.13); (c) the department of the interior for wildland fire management burned area emergency stabilization and rehabilitation (doi manual part 620, ch. 3); (d) the office of surface mining, or states with approved programs, for abandoned mine land reclamation activities under title iv of the surface mining control and reclamation act (30 cfr subchapter r), where the activity does not involve coal extraction; or (e) the farm service agency under its emergency conservation program (7 cfr part 701). in general, the prospective permittee should wait until the district engineer issues an nwp verification or 45 calendar days have passed before proceeding with the watershed a5-22 21 protection and rehabilitation activity. however, in cases where there is an unacceptable hazard to life or a significant loss of property or economic hardship will occur, the emergency watershed protection and rehabilitation activity may proceed immediately and the district engineer will consider the information in the pre-construction notification and any comments received as a result of agency coordination to decide whether the nwp 37 authorization should be modified, suspended, or revoked in accordance with the procedures at 33 cfr 330.5. notification: except in cases where there is an unacceptable hazard to life or a significant loss of property or economic hardship will occur, the permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity (see general condition 31). (sections 10 and 404) 38. cleanup of hazardous and toxic waste. specific activities required to effect the containment, stabilization, or removal of hazardous or toxic waste materials that are performed, ordered, or sponsored by a government agency with established legal or regulatory authority. court ordered remedial action plans or related settlements are also authorized by this nwp. this nwp does not authorize the establishment of new disposal sites or the expansion of existing sites used for the disposal of hazardous or toxic waste. notification: the permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity. (see general condition 31.)

(a) no activity is authorized under any nwp which is likely to directly or indirectly jeopardize the continued existence of a threatened or endangered species or a species proposed for such designation, as identified under the federal endangered species act (esa), or which will directly or indirectly destroy or adversely modify the critical habitat of such a5-32 31 species. no activity is authorized under any nwp which may affect a listed species or critical habitat, unless section 7 consultation addressing the effects of the proposed activity has been completed. (b) federal agencies should follow their own procedures for complying with the requirements of the esa. federal permittees must provide the district engineer with the appropriate documentation to demonstrate compliance with those requirements. the district engineer will review the documentation and determine whether it is sufficient to address esa compliance for the nwp activity, or whether additional esa consultation is necessary. (c) non-federal permittees must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer if any listed species or designated critical habitat might be affected or is in the vicinity of the project, or if the project is located in designated critical habitat, and shall not begin work on the activity until notified by the district engineer that the requirements of the esa have been satisfied and that the activity is authorized. for activities that might affect federally-listed endangered or threatened species or designated critical habitat, the pre-construction notification must include the name(s) of the endangered or threatened species that might be affected by the proposed work or that utilize the designated critical habitat that might be affected by the proposed work. the district engineer will determine whether the proposed activity may affect or will have no effect to listed species and designated critical habitat and will notify the nonfederal applicant of the corps determination within 45 days of receipt of a complete preconstruction notification. in cases where the non-federal applicant has identified listed species or critical habitat that might be affected or is in the vicinity of the project, and has so notified the corps, the applicant shall not begin work until the corps has provided notification the proposed activities will have no effect on listed species or critical habitat, or until section 7 consultation has been completed. if the non-federal applicant has not heard back from the corps within 45 days, the applicant must still wait for notification from the corps. (d) as a result of formal or informal consultation with the fws or nmfs the district engineer may add species-specific regional endangered species conditions to the nwps. (e) authorization of an activity by a nwp does not authorize the take of a threatened or endangered species as defined under the esa. in the absence of separate authorization (e.g., an esa section 10 permit, a biological opinion with incidental take provisions, etc.) from the u.s. fws or the nmfs, the endangered species act prohibits any person subject to the jurisdiction of the united states to take a listed species, where "take" means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct. the word harm in the definition of take'' means an act which actually kills or injures wildlife. such an act may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding or sheltering. (f) information on the location of threatened and endangered species and their critical habitat can be obtained directly from the offices of the u.s. fws and nmfs or their world wide web pages at http://www.fws.gov/ or http://www.fws.gov/ipac and http://www.noaa.gov/fisheries.html respectively. 19. migratory birds and bald and golden eagles. the permittee is responsible for obtaining any take permits required under the u.s. fish and wildlife service s regulations governing compliance with the migratory bird treaty act or the bald and golden eagle a5-33 32 protection act. the permittee should contact the appropriate local office of the u.s. fish and wildlife service to determine if such take permits are required for a particular activity. 20. historic properties. (a) in cases where the district engineer determines that the activity may affect properties listed, or eligible for listing, in the national register of historic places, the activity is not authorized, until the requirements of section 106 of the national historic preservation act (nhpa) have been satisfied. (b) federal permittees should follow their own procedures for complying with the requirements of section 106 of the national historic preservation act. federal permittees must provide the district engineer with the appropriate documentation to demonstrate compliance with those requirements. the district engineer will review the documentation and determine whether it is sufficient to address section 106 compliance for the nwp activity, or whether additional section 106 consultation is necessary. (c) non-federal permittees must submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer if the authorized activity may have the potential to cause effects to any historic properties listed on, determined to be eligible for listing on, or potentially eligible for listing on the national register of historic places, including previously unidentified properties. for such activities, the pre-construction notification must state which historic properties may be affected by the proposed work or include a vicinity map indicating the location of the historic properties or the potential for the presence of historic properties. assistance regarding information on the location of or potential for the presence of historic resources can be sought from the state historic preservation officer or tribal historic preservation officer, as appropriate, and the national register of historic places (see 33 cfr 330.4(g)). when reviewing pre-construction notifications, district engineers will comply with the current procedures for addressing the requirements of section 106 of the national historic preservation act. the district engineer shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to carry out appropriate identification efforts, which may include background research, consultation, oral history interviews, sample field investigation, and field survey. based on the information submitted and these efforts, the district engineer shall determine whether the proposed activity has the potential to cause an effect on the historic properties. where the non-federal applicant has identified historic properties on which the activity may have the potential to cause effects and so notified the corps, the non-federal applicant shall not begin the activity until notified by the district engineer either that the activity has no potential to cause effects or that consultation under section 106 of the nhpa has been completed. (d) the district engineer will notify the prospective permittee within 45 days of receipt of a complete pre-construction notification whether nhpa section 106 consultation is required. section 106 consultation is not required when the corps determines that the activity does not have the potential to cause effects on historic properties (see 36 cfr 800.3(a)). if nhpa section 106 consultation is required and will occur, the district engineer will notify the nonfederal applicant that he or she cannot begin work until section 106 consultation is completed. if the non-federal applicant has not heard back from the corps within 45 days, the applicant must still wait for notification from the corps. (e) prospective permittees should be aware that section 110k of the nhpa (16 u.s.c. 470h-2(k)) prevents the corps from granting a permit or other assistance to an applicant who, with intent to avoid the requirements of section 106 of the nhpa, has intentionally significantly adversely affected a historic property to which the permit would relate, or having legal power to a5-34 33 prevent it, allowed such significant adverse effect to occur, unless the corps, after consultation with the advisory council on historic preservation (achp), determines that circumstances justify granting such assistance despite the adverse effect created or permitted by the applicant. if circumstances justify granting the assistance, the corps is required to notify the achp and provide documentation specifying the circumstances, the degree of damage to the integrity of any historic properties affected, and proposed mitigation. this documentation must include any views obtained from the applicant, shpo/thpo, appropriate indian tribes if the undertaking occurs on or affects historic properties on tribal lands or affects properties of interest to those tribes, and other parties known to have a legitimate interest in the impacts to the permitted activity on historic properties. 21. discovery of previously unknown remains and artifacts. if you discover any previously unknown historic, cultural or archeological remains and artifacts while accomplishing the activity authorized by this permit, you must immediately notify the district engineer of what you have found, and to the maximum extent practicable, avoid construction activities that may affect the remains and artifacts until the required coordination has been completed. the district engineer will initiate the federal, tribal and state coordination required to determine if the items or remains warrant a recovery effort or if the site is eligible for listing in the national register of historic places. 22. designated critical resource waters. critical resource waters include, noaamanaged marine sanctuaries and marine monuments, and national estuarine research reserves. the district engineer may designate, after notice and opportunity for public comment, additional waters officially designated by a state as having particular environmental or ecological significance, such as outstanding national resource waters or state natural heritage sites. the district engineer may also designate additional critical resource waters after notice and opportunity for public comment. (a) discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the united states are not authorized by nwps 7, 12, 14, 16, 17, 21, 29, 31, 35, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 49, 50, 51, and 52 for any activity within, or directly affecting, critical resource waters, including wetlands adjacent to such waters. (b) for nwps 3, 8, 10, 13, 15, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 30, 33, 34, 36, 37, and 38, notification is required in accordance with general condition 31, for any activity proposed in the designated critical resource waters including wetlands adjacent to those waters. the district engineer may authorize activities under these nwps only after it is determined that the impacts to the critical resource waters will be no more than minimal. 23. mitigation. the district engineer will consider the following factors when determining appropriate and practicable mitigation necessary to ensure that adverse effects on the aquatic environment are minimal: (a) the activity must be designed and constructed to avoid and minimize adverse effects, both temporary and permanent, to waters of the united states to the maximum extent practicable at the project site (i.e., on site). (b) mitigation in all its forms (avoiding, minimizing, rectifying, reducing, or compensating for resource losses) will be required to the extent necessary to ensure that the adverse effects to the aquatic environment are minimal. a5-35 34 (c) compensatory mitigation at a minimum one-for-one ratio will be required for all wetland losses that exceed 1/10-acre and require pre-construction notification, unless the district engineer determines in writing that either some other form of mitigation would be more environmentally appropriate or the adverse effects of the proposed activity are minimal, and provides a project-specific waiver of this requirement. for wetland losses of 1/10-acre or less that require pre-construction notification, the district engineer may determine on a case-by-case basis that compensatory mitigation is required to ensure that the activity results in minimal adverse effects on the aquatic environment. compensatory mitigation projects provided to offset losses of aquatic resources must comply with the applicable provisions of 33 cfr part 332. (1) the prospective permittee is responsible for proposing an appropriate compensatory mitigation option if compensatory mitigation is necessary to ensure that the activity results in minimal adverse effects on the aquatic environment. (2) since the likelihood of success is greater and the impacts to potentially valuable uplands are reduced, wetland restoration should be the first compensatory mitigation option considered. (3) if permittee-responsible mitigation is the proposed option, the prospective permittee is responsible for submitting a mitigation plan. a conceptual or detailed mitigation plan may be used by the district engineer to make the decision on the nwp verification request, but a final mitigation plan that addresses the applicable requirements of 33 cfr 332.4(c)(2) (14) must be approved by the district engineer before the permittee begins work in waters of the united states, unless the district engineer determines that prior approval of the final mitigation plan is not practicable or not necessary to ensure timely completion of the required compensatory mitigation (see 33 cfr 332.3(k)(3)). (4) if mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program credits are the proposed option, the mitigation plan only needs to address the baseline conditions at the impact site and the number of credits to be provided. (5) compensatory mitigation requirements (e.g., resource type and amount to be provided as compensatory mitigation, site protection, ecological performance standards, monitoring requirements) may be addressed through conditions added to the nwp authorization, instead of components of a compensatory mitigation plan. (d) for losses of streams or other open waters that require pre-construction notification, the district engineer may require compensatory mitigation, such as stream rehabilitation, enhancement, or preservation, to ensure that the activity results in minimal adverse effects on the aquatic environment. (e) compensatory mitigation will not be used to increase the acreage losses allowed by the acreage limits of the nwps. for example, if an nwp has an acreage limit of 1/2-acre, it cannot be used to authorize any project resulting in the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of waters of the united states, even if compensatory mitigation is provided that replaces or restores some of the lost waters. however, compensatory mitigation can and should be used, as necessary, to ensure that a project already meeting the established acreage limits also satisfies the minimal impact requirement associated with the nwps. (f) compensatory mitigation plans for projects in or near streams or other open waters will normally include a requirement for the restoration or establishment, maintenance, and legal protection (e.g., conservation easements) of riparian areas next to open waters. in some cases, riparian areas may be the only compensatory mitigation required. riparian areas should consist of native species. the width of the required riparian area will address documented water quality a5-36 35 or aquatic habitat loss concerns. normally, the riparian area will be 25 to 50 feet wide on each side of the stream, but the district engineer may require slightly wider riparian areas to address documented water quality or habitat loss concerns. if it is not possible to establish a riparian area on both sides of a stream, or if the waterbody is a lake or coastal waters, then restoring or establishing a riparian area along a single bank or shoreline may be sufficient. where both wetlands and open waters exist on the project site, the district engineer will determine the appropriate compensatory mitigation (e.g., riparian areas and/or wetlands compensation) based on what is best for the aquatic environment on a watershed basis. in cases where riparian areas are determined to be the most appropriate form of compensatory mitigation, the district engineer may waive or reduce the requirement to provide wetland compensatory mitigation for wetland losses. (g) permittees may propose the use of mitigation banks, in-lieu fee programs, or separate permittee-responsible mitigation. for activities resulting in the loss of marine or estuarine resources, permittee-responsible compensatory mitigation may be environmentally preferable if there are no mitigation banks or in-lieu fee programs in the area that have marine or estuarine credits available for sale or transfer to the permittee. for permittee-responsible mitigation, the special conditions of the nwp verification must clearly indicate the party or parties responsible for the implementation and performance of the compensatory mitigation project, and, if required, its long-term management. (h) where certain functions and services of waters of the united states are permanently adversely affected, such as the conversion of a forested or scrub-shrub wetland to a herbaceous wetland in a permanently maintained utility line right-of-way, mitigation may be required to reduce the adverse effects of the project to the minimal level. 24. safety of impoundment structures. to ensure that all impoundment structures are safely designed, the district engineer may require non-federal applicants to demonstrate that the structures comply with established state dam safety criteria or have been designed by qualified persons. the district engineer may also require documentation that the design has been independently reviewed by similarly qualified persons, and appropriate modifications made to ensure safety. 25. water quality. where states and authorized tribes, or epa where applicable, have not previously certified compliance of an nwp with cwa section 401, individual 401 water quality certification must be obtained or waived (see 33 cfr 330.4(c)). the district engineer or state or tribe may require additional water quality management measures to ensure that the authorized activity does not result in more than minimal degradation of water quality. 26. coastal zone management. in coastal states where an nwp has not previously received a state coastal zone management consistency concurrence, an individual state coastal zone management consistency concurrence must be obtained, or a presumption of concurrence must occur (see 33 cfr 330.4(d)). the district engineer or a state may require additional measures to ensure that the authorized activity is consistent with state coastal zone management requirements. 27. regional and case-by-case conditions. the activity must comply with any regional conditions that may have been added by the division engineer (see 33 cfr 330.4(e)) and with a5-37 36 any case specific conditions added by the corps or by the state, indian tribe, or u.s. epa in its section 401 water quality certification, or by the state in its coastal zone management act consistency determination. 28. use of multiple nationwide permits. the use of more than one nwp for a single and complete project is prohibited, except when the acreage loss of waters of the united states authorized by the nwps does not exceed the acreage limit of the nwp with the highest specified acreage limit. for example, if a road crossing over tidal waters is constructed under nwp 14, with associated bank stabilization authorized by nwp 13, the maximum acreage loss of waters of the united states for the total project cannot exceed 1/3-acre. 29. transfer of nationwide permit verifications. if the permittee sells the property associated with a nationwide permit verification, the permittee may transfer the nationwide permit verification to the new owner by submitting a letter to the appropriate corps district office to validate the transfer. a copy of the nationwide permit verification must be attached to the letter, and the letter must contain the following statement and signature: when the structures or work authorized by this nationwide permit are still in existence at the time the property is transferred, the terms and conditions of this nationwide permit, including any special conditions, will continue to be binding on the new owner(s) of the property. to validate the transfer of this nationwide permit and the associated liabilities associated with compliance with its terms and conditions, have the transferee sign and date below. _____________________________________________ (transferee) _____________________________________________ (date) 30. compliance certification. each permittee who receives an nwp verification letter from the corps must provide a signed certification documenting completion of the authorized activity and any required compensatory mitigation. the success of any required permitteeresponsible mitigation, including the achievement of ecological performance standards, will be addressed separately by the district engineer. the corps will provide the permittee the certification document with the nwp verification letter. the certification document will include: (a) a statement that the authorized work was done in accordance with the nwp authorization, including any general, regional, or activity-specific conditions; (b) a statement that the implementation of any required compensatory mitigation was completed in accordance with the permit conditions. if credits from a mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program are used to satisfy the compensatory mitigation requirements, the certification must include the documentation required by 33 cfr 332.3(l)(3) to confirm that the permittee secured the appropriate number and resource type of credits; and (c) the signature of the permittee certifying the completion of the work and mitigation. a5-38 37 31. pre-construction notification. (a) timing. where required by the terms of the nwp, the prospective permittee must notify the district engineer by submitting a pre-construction notification (pcn) as early as possible. the district engineer must determine if the pcn is complete within 30 calendar days of the date of receipt and, if the pcn is determined to be incomplete, notify the prospective permittee within that 30 day period to request the additional information necessary to make the pcn complete. the request must specify the information needed to make the pcn complete. as a general rule, district engineers will request additional information necessary to make the pcn complete only once. however, if the prospective permittee does not provide all of the requested information, then the district engineer will notify the prospective permittee that the pcn is still incomplete and the pcn review process will not commence until all of the requested information has been received by the district engineer. the prospective permittee shall not begin the activity until either: (1) he or she is notified in writing by the district engineer that the activity may proceed under the nwp with any special conditions imposed by the district or division engineer; or (2) 45 calendar days have passed from the district engineer s receipt of the complete pcn and the prospective permittee has not received written notice from the district or division engineer. however, if the permittee was required to notify the corps pursuant to general condition 18 that listed species or critical habitat might be affected or in the vicinity of the project, or to notify the corps pursuant to general condition 20 that the activity may have the potential to cause effects to historic properties, the permittee cannot begin the activity until receiving written notification from the corps that there is no effect on listed species or no potential to cause effects on historic properties, or that any consultation required under section 7 of the endangered species act (see 33 cfr 330.4(f)) and/or section 106 of the national historic preservation (see 33 cfr 330.4(g)) has been completed. also, work cannot begin under nwps 21, 49, or 50 until the permittee has received written approval from the corps. if the proposed activity requires a written waiver to exceed specified limits of an nwp, the permittee may not begin the activity until the district engineer issues the waiver. if the district or division engineer notifies the permittee in writing that an individual permit is required within 45 calendar days of receipt of a complete pcn, the permittee cannot begin the activity until an individual permit has been obtained. subsequently, the permittee s right to proceed under the nwp may be modified, suspended, or revoked only in accordance with the procedure set forth in 33 cfr 330.5(d)(2). (b) contents of pre-construction notification: the pcn must be in writing and include the following information: (1) name, address and telephone numbers of the prospective permittee; (2) location of the proposed project; (3) a description of the proposed project; the project s purpose; direct and indirect adverse environmental effects the project would cause, including the anticipated amount of loss of water of the united states expected to result from the nwp activity, in acres, linear feet, or other appropriate unit of measure; any other nwp(s), regional general permit(s), or individual permit(s) used or intended to be used to authorize any part of the proposed project or any related activity. the description should be sufficiently detailed to allow the district engineer to determine that the adverse effects of the project will be minimal and to determine the need for compensatory mitigation. sketches should be provided when necessary to show that the activity complies with the terms of the nwp. (sketches usually clarify the project and when provided results in a quicker decision. sketches should contain sufficient detail to provide an illustrative a5-39 38 description of the proposed activity (e.g., a conceptual plan), but do not need to be detailed engineering plans); (4) the pcn must include a delineation of wetlands, other special aquatic sites, and other waters, such as lakes and ponds, and perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral streams, on the project site. wetland delineations must be prepared in accordance with the current method required by the corps. the permittee may ask the corps to delineate the special aquatic sites and other waters on the project site, but there may be a delay if the corps does the delineation, especially if the project site is large or contains many waters of the united states. furthermore, the 45 day period will not start until the delineation has been submitted to or completed by the corps, as appropriate; (5) if the proposed activity will result in the loss of greater than 1/10-acre of wetlands and a pcn is required, the prospective permittee must submit a statement describing how the mitigation requirement will be satisfied, or explaining why the adverse effects are minimal and why compensatory mitigation should not be required. as an alternative, the prospective permittee may submit a conceptual or detailed mitigation plan. (6) if any listed species or designated critical habitat might be affected or is in the vicinity of the project, or if the project is located in designated critical habitat, for non-federal applicants the pcn must include the name(s) of those endangered or threatened species that might be affected by the proposed work or utilize the designated critical habitat that may be affected by the proposed work. federal applicants must provide documentation demonstrating compliance with the endangered species act; and (7) for an activity that may affect a historic property listed on, determined to be eligible for listing on, or potentially eligible for listing on, the national register of historic places, for non-federal applicants the pcn must state which historic property may be affected by the proposed work or include a vicinity map indicating the location of the historic property. federal applicants must provide documentation demonstrating compliance with section 106 of the national historic preservation act. (c) form of pre-construction notification: the standard individual permit application form (form eng 4345) may be used, but the completed application form must clearly indicate that it is a pcn and must include all of the information required in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this general condition. a letter containing the required information may also be used. (d) agency coordination: (1) the district engineer will consider any comments from federal and state agencies concerning the proposed activity s compliance with the terms and conditions of the nwps and the need for mitigation to reduce the project s adverse environmental effects to a minimal level. (2) for all nwp activities that require pre-construction notification and result in the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of waters of the united states, for nwp 21, 29, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 50, 51, and 52 activities that require pre-construction notification and will result in the loss of greater than 300 linear feet of intermittent and ephemeral stream bed, and for all nwp 48 activities that require pre-construction notification, the district engineer will immediately provide (e.g., via email, facsimile transmission, overnight mail, or other expeditious manner) a copy of the complete pcn to the appropriate federal or state offices (u.s. fws, state natural resource or water quality agency, epa, state historic preservation officer (shpo) or tribal historic preservation office (thpo), and, if appropriate, the nmfs). with the exception of nwp 37, these agencies will have 10 calendar days from the date the material is transmitted to telephone or fax the district engineer notice that they intend to provide substantive, site-specific comments. a5-40 39 the comments must explain why the agency believes the adverse effects will be more than minimal. if so contacted by an agency, the district engineer will wait an additional 15 calendar days before making a decision on the pre-construction notification. the district engineer will fully consider agency comments received within the specified time frame concerning the proposed activity s compliance with the terms and conditions of the nwps, including the need for mitigation to ensure the net adverse environmental effects to the aquatic environment of the proposed activity are minimal. the district engineer will provide no response to the resource agency, except as provided below. the district engineer will indicate in the administrative record associated with each pre-construction notification that the resource agencies concerns were considered. for nwp 37, the emergency watershed protection and rehabilitation activity may proceed immediately in cases where there is an unacceptable hazard to life or a significant loss of property or economic hardship will occur. the district engineer will consider any comments received to decide whether the nwp 37 authorization should be modified, suspended, or revoked in accordance with the procedures at 33 cfr 330.5. (3) in cases of where the prospective permittee is not a federal agency, the district engineer will provide a response to nmfs within 30 calendar days of receipt of any essential fish habitat conservation recommendations, as required by section 305(b)(4)(b) of the magnuson-stevens fishery conservation and management act. (4) applicants are encouraged to provide the corps with either electronic files or multiple copies of pre-construction notifications to expedite agency coordination. d. district engineer s decision 1. in reviewing the pcn for the proposed activity, the district engineer will determine whether the activity authorized by the nwp will result in more than minimal individual or cumulative adverse environmental effects or may be contrary to the public interest. for a linear project, this determination will include an evaluation of the individual crossings to determine whether they individually satisfy the terms and conditions of the nwp(s), as well as the cumulative effects caused by all of the crossings authorized by nwp. if an applicant requests a waiver of the 300 linear foot limit on impacts to intermittent or ephemeral streams or of an otherwise applicable limit, as provided for in nwps 13, 21, 29, 36, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 50, 51 or 52, the district engineer will only grant the waiver upon a written determination that the nwp activity will result in minimal adverse effects. when making minimal effects determinations the district engineer will consider the direct and indirect effects caused by the nwp activity. the district engineer will also consider site specific factors, such as the environmental setting in the vicinity of the nwp activity, the type of resource that will be affected by the nwp activity, the functions provided by the aquatic resources that will be affected by the nwp activity, the degree or magnitude to which the aquatic resources perform those functions, the extent that aquatic resource functions will be lost as a result of the nwp activity (e.g., partial or complete loss), the duration of the adverse effects (temporary or permanent), the importance of the aquatic resource functions to the region (e.g., watershed or ecoregion), and mitigation required by the district engineer. if an appropriate functional assessment method is available and practicable to use, that assessment method may be used by the district engineer to assist in the minimal adverse effects determination. the district engineer may add case-specific special conditions to the nwp authorization to address site-specific environmental concerns. a5-41 40 2. if the proposed activity requires a pcn and will result in a loss of greater than 1/10- acre of wetlands, the prospective permittee should submit a mitigation proposal with the pcn. applicants may also propose compensatory mitigation for projects with smaller impacts. the district engineer will consider any proposed compensatory mitigation the applicant has included in the proposal in determining whether the net adverse environmental effects to the aquatic environment of the proposed activity are minimal. the compensatory mitigation proposal may be either conceptual or detailed. if the district engineer determines that the activity complies with the terms and conditions of the nwp and that the adverse effects on the aquatic environment are minimal, after considering mitigation, the district engineer will notify the permittee and include any activity-specific conditions in the nwp verification the district engineer deems necessary. conditions for compensatory mitigation requirements must comply with the appropriate provisions at 33 cfr 332.3(k). the district engineer must approve the final mitigation plan before the permittee commences work in waters of the united states, unless the district engineer determines that prior approval of the final mitigation plan is not practicable or not necessary to ensure timely completion of the required compensatory mitigation. if the prospective permittee elects to submit a compensatory mitigation plan with the pcn, the district engineer will expeditiously review the proposed compensatory mitigation plan. the district engineer must review the proposed compensatory mitigation plan within 45 calendar days of receiving a complete pcn and determine whether the proposed mitigation would ensure no more than minimal adverse effects on the aquatic environment. if the net adverse effects of the project on the aquatic environment (after consideration of the compensatory mitigation proposal) are determined by the district engineer to be minimal, the district engineer will provide a timely written response to the applicant. the response will state that the project can proceed under the terms and conditions of the nwp, including any activity-specific conditions added to the nwp authorization by the district engineer. 3. if the district engineer determines that the adverse effects of the proposed work are more than minimal, then the district engineer will notify the applicant either: (a) that the project does not qualify for authorization under the nwp and instruct the applicant on the procedures to seek authorization under an individual permit; (b) that the project is authorized under the nwp subject to the applicant s submission of a mitigation plan that would reduce the adverse effects on the aquatic environment to the minimal level; or (c) that the project is authorized under the nwp with specific modifications or conditions. where the district engineer determines that mitigation is required to ensure no more than minimal adverse effects occur to the aquatic environment, the activity will be authorized within the 45-day pcn period, with activity-specific conditions that state the mitigation requirements. the authorization will include the necessary conceptual or detailed mitigation or a requirement that the applicant submit a mitigation plan that would reduce the adverse effects on the aquatic environment to the minimal level. when mitigation is required, no work in waters of the united states may occur until the district engineer has approved a specific mitigation plan or has determined that prior approval of a final mitigation plan is not practicable or not necessary to ensure timely completion of the required compensatory mitigation. a5-42 41 e. further information 1. district engineers have authority to determine if an activity complies with the terms and conditions of an nwp. 2. nwps do not obviate the need to obtain other federal, state, or local permits, approvals, or authorizations required by law. 3. nwps do not grant any property rights or exclusive privileges. 4. nwps do not authorize any injury to the property or rights of others. 5. nwps do not authorize interference with any existing or proposed federal project. f. definitions best management practices (bmps): policies, practices, procedures, or structures implemented to mitigate the adverse environmental effects on surface water quality resulting from development. bmps are categorized as structural or non-structural. compensatory mitigation: the restoration (re-establishment or rehabilitation), establishment (creation), enhancement, and/or in certain circumstances preservation of aquatic resources for the purposes of offsetting unavoidable adverse impacts which remain after all appropriate and practicable avoidance and minimization has been achieved. currently serviceable: useable as is or with some maintenance, but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. direct effects: effects that are caused by the activity and occur at the same time and place. discharge: the term discharge means any discharge of dredged or fill material. enhancement: the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of an aquatic resource to heighten, intensify, or improve a specific aquatic resource function(s). enhancement results in the gain of selected aquatic resource function(s), but may also lead to a decline in other aquatic resource function(s). enhancement does not result in a gain in aquatic resource area. ephemeral stream: an ephemeral stream has flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year. ephemeral stream beds are located above the water table year-round. groundwater is not a source of water for the stream. runoff from rainfall is the primary source of water for stream flow. establishment (creation): the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics present to develop an aquatic resource that did not previously exist at an upland site. establishment results in a gain in aquatic resource area. high tide line: the line of intersection of the land with the water s surface at the maximum height reached by a rising tide. the high tide line may be determined, in the absence of actual data, by a line of oil or scum along shore objects, a more or less continuous deposit of fine shell or debris on the foreshore or berm, other physical markings or characteristics, vegetation lines, tidal gages, or other suitable means that delineate the general height reached by a rising tide. the line encompasses spring high tides and other high tides that occur with periodic frequency but does not include storm surges in which there is a departure from the normal or predicted reach of the tide due to the piling up of water against a coast by strong winds such as those accompanying a hurricane or other intense storm. a5-43 42 historic property: any prehistoric or historic district, site (including archaeological site), building, structure, or other object included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the national register of historic places maintained by the secretary of the interior. this term includes artifacts, records, and remains that are related to and located within such properties. the term includes properties of traditional religious and cultural importance to an indian tribe or native hawaiian organization and that meet the national register criteria (36 cfr part 60). independent utility: a test to determine what constitutes a single and complete non-linear project in the corps regulatory program. a project is considered to have independent utility if it would be constructed absent the construction of other projects in the project area. portions of a multi-phase project that depend upon other phases of the project do not have independent utility. phases of a project that would be constructed even if the other phases were not built can be considered as separate single and complete projects with independent utility. indirect effects: effects that are caused by the activity and are later in time or farther removed in distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable. intermittent stream: an intermittent stream has flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow. during dry periods, intermittent streams may not have flowing water. runoff from rainfall is a supplemental source of water for stream flow. loss of waters of the united states: waters of the united states that are permanently adversely affected by filling, flooding, excavation, or drainage because of the regulated activity. permanent adverse effects include permanent discharges of dredged or fill material that change an aquatic area to dry land, increase the bottom elevation of a waterbody, or change the use of a waterbody. the acreage of loss of waters of the united states is a threshold measurement of the impact to jurisdictional waters for determining whether a project may qualify for an nwp; it is not a net threshold that is calculated after considering compensatory mitigation that may be used to offset losses of aquatic functions and services. the loss of stream bed includes the linear feet of stream bed that is filled or excavated. waters of the united states temporarily filled, flooded, excavated, or drained, but restored to pre-construction contours and elevations after construction, are not included in the measurement of loss of waters of the united states. impacts resulting from activities eligible for exemptions under section 404(f) of the clean water act are not considered when calculating the loss of waters of the united states. non-tidal wetland: a non-tidal wetland is a wetland that is not subject to the ebb and flow of tidal waters. the definition of a wetland can be found at 33 cfr 328.3(b). non-tidal wetlands contiguous to tidal waters are located landward of the high tide line (i.e., spring high tide line). open water: for purposes of the nwps, an open water is any area that in a year with normal patterns of precipitation has water flowing or standing above ground to the extent that an ordinary high water mark can be determined. aquatic vegetation within the area of standing or flowing water is either non-emergent, sparse, or absent. vegetated shallows are considered to be open waters. examples of open waters include rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds. ordinary high water mark: an ordinary high water mark is a line on the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics, or by other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas (see 33 cfr 328.3(e)). perennial stream: a perennial stream has flowing water year-round during a typical year. the water table is located above the stream bed for most of the year. groundwater is the primary a5-44 43 source of water for stream flow. runoff from rainfall is a supplemental source of water for stream flow. practicable: available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purposes. pre-construction notification: a request submitted by the project proponent to the corps for confirmation that a particular activity is authorized by nationwide permit. the request may be a permit application, letter, or similar document that includes information about the proposed work and its anticipated environmental effects. pre-construction notification may be required by the terms and conditions of a nationwide permit, or by regional conditions. a pre-construction notification may be voluntarily submitted in cases where pre-construction notification is not required and the project proponent wants confirmation that the activity is authorized by nationwide permit. preservation: the removal of a threat to, or preventing the decline of, aquatic resources by an action in or near those aquatic resources. this term includes activities commonly associated with the protection and maintenance of aquatic resources through the implementation of appropriate legal and physical mechanisms. preservation does not result in a gain of aquatic resource area or functions. re-establishment: the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural/historic functions to a former aquatic resource. re-establishment results in rebuilding a former aquatic resource and results in a gain in aquatic resource area and functions. rehabilitation: the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of repairing natural/historic functions to a degraded aquatic resource. rehabilitation results in a gain in aquatic resource function, but does not result in a gain in aquatic resource area. restoration: the manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural/historic functions to a former or degraded aquatic resource. for the purpose of tracking net gains in aquatic resource area, restoration is divided into two categories: re-establishment and rehabilitation. riffle and pool complex: riffle and pool complexes are special aquatic sites under the 404(b)(1) guidelines. riffle and pool complexes sometimes characterize steep gradient sections of streams. such stream sections are recognizable by their hydraulic characteristics. the rapid movement of water over a course substrate in riffles results in a rough flow, a turbulent surface, and high dissolved oxygen levels in the water. pools are deeper areas associated with riffles. a slower stream velocity, a streaming flow, a smooth surface, and a finer substrate characterize pools. riparian areas: riparian areas are lands adjacent to streams, lakes, and estuarine-marine shorelines. riparian areas are transitional between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, through which surface and subsurface hydrology connects riverine, lacustrine, estuarine, and marine waters with their adjacent wetlands, non-wetland waters, or uplands. riparian areas provide a variety of ecological functions and services and help improve or maintain local water quality. (see general condition 23.) shellfish seeding: the placement of shellfish seed and/or suitable substrate to increase shellfish production. shellfish seed consists of immature individual shellfish or individual shellfish attached to shells or shell fragments (i.e., spat on shell). suitable substrate may consist a5-45 44 of shellfish shells, shell fragments, or other appropriate materials placed into waters for shellfish habitat. single and complete linear project: a linear project is a project constructed for the purpose of getting people, goods, or services from a point of origin to a terminal point, which often involves multiple crossings of one or more waterbodies at separate and distant locations. the term single and complete project is defined as that portion of the total linear project proposed or accomplished by one owner/developer or partnership or other association of owners/developers that includes all crossings of a single water of the united states (i.e., a single waterbody) at a specific location. for linear projects crossing a single or multiple waterbodies several times at separate and distant locations, each crossing is considered a single and complete project for purposes of nwp authorization. however, individual channels in a braided stream or river, or individual arms of a large, irregularly shaped wetland or lake, etc., are not separate waterbodies, and crossings of such features cannot be considered separately. single and complete non-linear project: for non-linear projects, the term single and complete project is defined at 33 cfr 330.2(i) as the total project proposed or accomplished by one owner/developer or partnership or other association of owners/developers. a single and complete non-linear project must have independent utility (see definition of independent utility ). single and complete non-linear projects may not be piecemealed to avoid the limits in an nwp authorization. stormwater management: stormwater management is the mechanism for controlling stormwater runoff for the purposes of reducing downstream erosion, water quality degradation, and flooding and mitigating the adverse effects of changes in land use on the aquatic environment. stormwater management facilities: stormwater management facilities are those facilities, including but not limited to, stormwater retention and detention ponds and best management practices, which retain water for a period of time to control runoff and/or improve the quality (i.e., by reducing the concentration of nutrients, sediments, hazardous substances and other pollutants) of stormwater runoff. stream bed: the substrate of the stream channel between the ordinary high water marks. the substrate may be bedrock or inorganic particles that range in size from clay to boulders. wetlands contiguous to the stream bed, but outside of the ordinary high water marks, are not considered part of the stream bed. stream channelization: the manipulation of a stream s course, condition, capacity, or location that causes more than minimal interruption of normal stream processes. a channelized stream remains a water of the united states. structure: an object that is arranged in a definite pattern of organization. examples of structures include, without limitation, any pier, boat dock, boat ramp, wharf, dolphin, weir, boom, breakwater, bulkhead, revetment, riprap, jetty, artificial island, artificial reef, permanent mooring structure, power transmission line, permanently moored floating vessel, piling, aid to navigation, or any other manmade obstacle or obstruction. tidal wetland: a tidal wetland is a wetland (i.e., water of the united states) that is inundated by tidal waters. the definitions of a wetland and tidal waters can be found at 33 cfr 328.3(b) and 33 cfr 328.3(f), respectively. tidal waters rise and fall in a predictable and measurable rhythm or cycle due to the gravitational pulls of the moon and sun. tidal waters end where the rise and fall of the water surface can no longer be practically measured in a predictable a5-46 45 rhythm due to masking by other waters, wind, or other effects. tidal wetlands are located channelward of the high tide line, which is defined at 33 cfr 328.3(d). vegetated shallows: vegetated shallows are special aquatic sites under the 404(b)(1) guidelines. they are areas that are permanently inundated and under normal circumstances have rooted aquatic vegetation, such as seagrasses in marine and estuarine systems and a variety of vascular rooted plants in freshwater systems. waterbody: for purposes of the nwps, a waterbody is a jurisdictional water of the united states. if a jurisdictional wetland is adjacent meaning bordering, contiguous, or neighboring to a waterbody determined to be a water of the united states under 33 cfr 328.3(a)(1)-(6), that waterbody and its adjacent wetlands are considered together as a single aquatic unit (see 33 cfr 328.4(c)(2)). examples of waterbodies include streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, and wetlands. a5-47 1 2012 nationwide permits final regional conditions seattle district march 19, 2012 a. general regional conditions (apply to all

geologic mapping: david h. scofield, p.e., p.e.g. date: 15oct2012 purpose: the purpose of this memorandum is to document the foundation conditions exposed and prepared for the rcc spillway structure. the spillway structure is designed to be raised in increments as conditions warrant up to 30 feet in height. river diversion: the contractor diverted the low late-summer flow through the southern half of the spillway approach channel. the northern portion of the spillway was protected by temporary dikes on the upstream and southern (river) side. once the northern portion of the structure which includes the low flow channel and stilling basin was constructed, the contractor diverted the river to the north and over the new spillway crest. the contractor then completed the southern portion of the structure. original foundation excavation: originally, the rock removed from the spillway was blasted and excavated to the designed grade lines. because it was not a foundation for concrete structures, no special precautions were taken. the rock was blasted and excavated in mass. hence, the top of rock / grade line was highly broken/fragmented from blast damage and excavation. photographs of the upstream edge of the stilling basin cut shows the typical mantling of loosened/fragment rock overlying irregular contact of more intact rock. photo 1 and 2. upstream edge of the stilling basin excavation. photo shows the mantling of loosen and fragmented rock mantling more intact bedrock. stilling basin foundation is fragmented rock. foundation excavation, clean up, and preparation: since, original construction, the sediments have covered the approach channel and built up to the spillway crest. the contractor excavated this sediment down to the original grade lines/bedrock with conventional equipment. grade lines for the dam raised were adopted from the 1986 spillway design drawings. the actual top of rock line was at or slightly below the design grade lines. foundation rock exposed was highly broken up and fragmented most likely from the original construction with varying amount of sediments deposited into the voids. excavation further mixed the sediments and rock fragments exposed. because of the original heavy mantle of fragmented rock intact rock stilling basin attachment a7 for information only (fio) a7-1 fio blast damage, there was little true intact in-place rock exposed at the designed foundation grade. the contractor was directed to stop excavating at the designed grade line and not to continue to excavate to intact rock below. the fragment rock condition was not anticipated, structural stability was rechecked to verify that the exposed foundation conditions was adequate for the planned full 30-foot raise. photo 3. final foundation of the northern half of the spillway crest. spillway crest is on the right portion, stilling basin in the center and the low flow channel on the left. the mixed sediment and fragmented rock condition caused difficulties in foundation clean up. mechanical equipment just continued to loosen more rock deeper and mix the sediments in. the eventual solution was to let the expose foundation dry out as much as possible and then clean the foundation with sweeper on a bobcat and high air pressure stream (photograph 4). the goal was to clean the foundation to at least where 50 percent of the exposed surface area would be rock fragments with the remaining surface exposed as sand and silt sediments. photo 4. sweeper on a bob cat used to clean final foundation. a7-2 fio the foundation was cleaned as best could and was judged to be adequate for the intended structure. foundation ranged from intact massive flow breccias to highly fractured basalt, fragmented rock with less than 50 percent sediment, and fragmented rock with more than 50 percent sediment. all foundations were firm to walk and drive heavy equipment over. photographs of typical levels of cleaning are shown.

was prepared and mapped in two stages. previous mapping of the approach channel in 1986 did not different the exposed rock. geologic mapping, generally differentiated the areas of intact basalt rock, areas of flow breccias, and areas of fragmented rock. all contacts are gradational, so contacts should only be considered approximate. field mapping was done a7-3 fio by waling over the surface and measuring with a cloth tape. final compiled geologic map is shown in figure 1. the most notable feature in the foundation was a dewatering trench from drainage operation that was left in place at station 0+195 167 lt. this trench was about 7 feet wide by 3 feet deep. it was backfilled with broken rock. the location of this trench was measured from the first foundation drain coming up out of the stilling basin. foundation drains: original design intended foundation drains to be drilled 5 feet into the underlying bedrock on 10 foot spacing beneath the rcc structure. because of the highly broken nature of the foundation, there was concern that seepage may be greater than anticipated. to address seepage concerns, foundation drains were drilled on foot spacing. the northern foundation drains were observed with pool up to the new spillway crest. no water was observed coming out of the above water drain holes. this suggests that through seepage beneath the structure is low enough that the fragment rock foundation provides a natural drainage blanket. foundation drains flowing water in bend of structure at the south end. foundation backwards erosion beneath structure: a concern was identified that backward erosion of the broken rock could initiate at the stilling basin where the rcc cover is the thinnest. to forestall this possibility, the optional over excavation and constructing an 8 foot thick rcc layer at the upstream side of the stilling basin was executed. a7-4 fio future problems: no future problems are anticipated. it should be noted that higher drainage flow may be observed in one or two foundation drains located where the drainage ditch was backfilled with rock and left in place beneath the foundation. this will not expected to cause an internal erosion problem because of the large rock size and low hydraulic gradient. future considerations: although, the foundation is not ideal, it is adequate for the designed structure. for future consideration, the foundation beneath the spillway raise should be considered a mixture of sediments and fragmented rock or a pit-run rock . if the spillway is ever raised above the planned 30 feet, new geotechnical investigation will have to be done. for future stability analysis, a continuous upstream-downstream layer of mixed soil/fragmented rock should be considered. a7-5 fio 1997 rcc 1997

got it to work in gis. i was able to get something to compare to my 2014 lidar dem, but i had to simplify your polygons by merging all the skinny angles into fewer large triangles. looks like it kept

contours), while gray is from trd1.101_cont wa2011sf (as built first raise). delta is due to measurement error, and modelling method given analysis of full 2nd raise foot print, the 2014 bathy lidar contrast 1st raise built (2012) shows 3,300cy of fill and 580 cut. height deltas vary from 7.5 to +6.5. this represents an estimate of the fill material and error associated with bathy lidar. thus, using the 2014 bathy lidar to compute the volume of rcc placed may be an under estimate by around 10%. if existing conditions were surveyed today changes in fill volume will still exists given the intervening 8 years of flow, erosion and sedimentation. usace did not use the as built data to document existing conditions in the second raise contract because we did not fully trust the survey work completed and we chose a shift in horizontal datum from nad27 to nad83. these facts reinforced our decision to require the contractor perform surveys for quantity take off and specifications were
