Pursuant to the FAR 52.229-3 Federal, State, and Local Taxes, taxes imposed under 26 U.S.C. 5000 C may not be included in the contract price or
reimbursed.
Exemptions from this excise tax must be claimed by an Offeror when it submits, with its offer, a U.S. Department of Treasury Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) Form W-14, Certificate of Foreign Contracting Party Receiving Federal Procurement Payments, available via the internet at www.irs.
gov/W14. If not submitted with the offer, exemptions will not be applied to any resulting contract and the Government will withhold a full 2 percent
00 21 13-2
on each contract payment. Failure to submit an IRS Form W-14 with each payment request will also result in an automatic withholding of 2 percent
from the payment request.
When filling out the IRS Form W-14 the following information may be used to complete Part I, Lines 6 and 7.
Line 6 Contract/reference number: W9127N26BA004
Line 7 "Name and address of the acquiring agency":
USACE Portland District
333 SW First Avenue
Portland, Oregon 97204-3440
503-808-4616
Any exemption claimed and self-certified is subject to audit by the IRS. Any disputes concerning this tax are adjudicated by the IRS because the
Section 5000C tax is a tax matter not a contract issue.
Offerors are encouraged to seek guidance from their own tax professionals for advice concerning the provision, clause, and exclusions exclusion
/submission of IRS Form W-14. Additional information is also available at:
Notwithstanding the above, the USACE does not have a means of withholding this excise tax at this time. As a result, contractors are expected to
comply with the instructions above and to properly complete and return the W-14 at proposal submission, and with each pay application. The amount
due for each withholding will be confirmed by USACE, BUT WILL NOT BE WITHHELD. It is the contractor's responsibility to set aside, or remit to
the IRS, the amount confirmed by USACE. Whether the contractor sets the money aside for future payment to the IRS, or makes payment to the IRS,
is the contractor's discretion, based on its analysis of the regulations regarding the excise tax. In the event that USACE is able to withhold during
contract performance, it will notify the contractor and make such a withholding (including any catch up withholdings); no advance notice is required
to the contractor prior to the withholding. Under no circumstances is USACE liable for any tax not paid by the contractor. The contractor is liable for
the tax, to the extent required by law, regardless of whether USACE makes a withholding.
FAR 29.204 expressly states that "[a]gencies merely withhold the tax (section 5000C tax) for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). All substantive
issues regarding the underlying section 5000C tax, e.g., the imposition of, and exemption from the tax, are matters under the jurisdiction of the IRS."
Therefore, we cannot help you determine how the tax law applies to you. We strongly recommend that you contact the IRS and/or a tax professional
should you have any questions of this nature. To be clear, this information does not constitute tax advice or a representation of your tax liability.
Furnishing this information does not create liability for the USACE for any Federal, state, or local taxes applicable to the above-referenced contract or
any other contract.
***************************
For submission requirements and basis of evaluation:
Executed FAR Provision 52.229-11.
Completed IRS Form W-14, Certificate of Foreign Contracting Party Receiving Federal Procurement Payments, if applicable. If not submitted with
the offer, exemptions will not be applied to any resulting contract and the Government will withhold a full 2 percent on each payment.
NOTICE TO LARGE BUSINESS FIRMS
Please see FAR Clauses 52.219-8, "Utilization of Small Business Concerns (SEP 2023)" and 52.219-9, "Small Business Subcontracting Plan (SEP
2023)." Large business concerns submitting offers of $750,000 or more for supplies or services or $1,500,000 for construction are required to submit
a subcontracting plan upon request by the Contracting Officer. The plan must express goals in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting
dollars and must be comparable to the dollar commitments in the small business participation plan, if applicable.
DEFINITIONS:
Subcontract means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Government prime contractor or
subcontractor calling for supplies and/or services required for performance of the contract, contract modification, or subcontract.
00 21 13-3
Small Business Concern means a concern, including its affiliates that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in
which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria and size standards in FAR 19.102. Such a concern is
"not dominant in its field of operation" when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in
which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged.
Floor is the term the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers uses to replace goal. It represents the minimum level for small business performance.
Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) means the Government wide, electronic, web-based system for small business subcontracting
program reporting. The eSRS is located at http://www.esrs.gov.
The following floors are considered reasonable and achievable during the performance of the contract resulting from this solicitation and are included
for information purposes. Final floors will be reviewed prior to contract award, and the subcontracting plan will then become a material part of the
contract.
a. 5% of the total subcontracted dollar value will be placed with all small business concerns. For the purpose of this subcontracting plan, Small
Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Women-owned Small Business (WOSB), HUBZone Small Business, Veteran-owned Small Business, and
Service Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business concerns are subsets of small business concerns.
b. 1% of the total subcontracted contract dollar value will be placed with small disadvantaged business concerns or Historically Black Colleges
and Universities or Minority Institutions. To be considered a small disadvantaged business concern, business must be certified by the Small
Business Administration in addition to meeting the definition under FAR Clause 52.219-8(c)(3).
c. 1% of the total subcontracted contract dollar value will be placed with small women-owned business concerns. Women-owned business
concerns may meet the definition of a small disadvantaged business. If so, it will also be considered a subset of a small disadvantaged business
concern.
d. 1% of the total subcontracted contract dollar value will be placed with HUBZone small business concerns. To be considered a HUBZone
small business concern, business must be certified by the U.S. Small Business Administration in addition to meeting the definition under FAR
Clause 52.219-8(c)(3).
e. 3% of the total subcontracted dollar value will be placed with Veteran-owned small business concerns.
f. 1% of the total subcontracted dollar value will be placed with Service Disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns.
Floors included in any proposed plan should be at least equal to the recommended floors. If lesser floors are proposed, include an explanation for how
those floors and the overall plan represent best efforts to comply with the policy outlined in the contract clauses.
The proposed subcontracting plan must address how the offeror will maximize subcontracting opportunities within the small business communities of
the project location. Demonstrated outreach efforts through conference attendance, use of SAM.gov, and corporate support of the Small Business
Program Liaison Officer and Small Business Program must be addressed in the proposed subcontracting plan.
Subcontracting plans will be evaluated using Appendix DD to the Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS) 5119.705-4(d) to
determine the offeror's ability to carry out the terms and conditions set forth in the contract clauses. If discussions during this review raise doubts
regarding intentions or ability to comply with contractual obligations, it could result in disqualification for award. Failure to receive a subcontracting
plan rating of Acceptable could jeopardize the offeror's selection for contract award.

Project Labor Agreement
To be considered for award, all bidders must submit a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) as required for large-scale construction projects in accordance
with FAR 22.503 and FAR Clause 52.222-33. The Government is not a party to the PLA. Per 52.222-33 subparagraph (b)(2), subcontractors are a
party to the PLA. However, it is not necessary for all subcontractors sign the PLA, but they must agree to the terms of the PLA negotiated by the
prime contractor and labor organization. The prime contractor can meet the requirements of subparagraph (b)(2) by either: 1) inserting language into
the subcontract requiring the subcontractor to acknowledge and abide by the terms of the PLA; 2) having each subcontractor sign a Letter of Assent or
an Affidavit of PLA Participation.
At a minimum, the proposed PLA must address the requirements in FAR 22.504(b), which states a project labor agreement shall -
(1) Bind all contractors and subcontractors engaged in construction on the construction project to comply with the project labor agreement;
(2) Allow all contractors and subcontractors to compete for contracts and subcontracts without regard to whether they are otherwise parties to
collective bargaining agreements;
(3) Contain guarantees against strikes, lockouts, and similar job disruptions;
(4) Set forth effective, prompt, and mutually binding procedures for resolving labor disputes arising during the term of the project labor agreement;
(5) Provide other mechanisms for labor-management cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern, including productivity, quality of work,
safety, and health; and
(6) Include any additional requirements as the agency deems necessary to satisfy its needs. If the apparent low bidder does not submit an acceptable
LA, they may be ineligible for award and the contracting officer may move on the second low bidder. Any PLA reached does not change the terms of
this contract or provide for any price adjustment by the Government.
22.504 General requirements for project labor agreements.
(a) General. Project labor agreements established under this subpart shall fully conform to all statutes, regulations, and Executive orders.
(b) Requirements. A project labor agreement shall-
(1) Bind all contractors and subcontractors engaged in construction on the construction project to comply with the project labor agreement;
00 22 00-1
(2) Allow all contractors and subcontractors to compete for contracts and subcontracts without regard to whether they are otherwise parties to
collective bargaining agreements;
(3) Contain guarantees against strikes, lockouts, and similar job disruptions;
(4) Set forth effective, prompt, and mutually binding procedures for resolving labor disputes arising during the term of the project labor agreement;
(5) Provide other mechanisms for labor-management cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern, including productivity, quality of work,
safety, and health; and
(6) Include any additional requirements as the agency deems necessary to satisfy its needs.
(c) Labor organizations. An agency may not require contractors or subcontractors to enter into a project labor agreement with any particular labor
organization.
(d) Exceptions to project labor agreement requirements--
(1) Exception. The senior procurement executive may grant an exception from the requirements at 22.503(b), providing a specific written explanation
of why at least one of the following conditions exists with respect to the particular contract:
(i) Requiring a project labor agreement on the project would not advance the Federal Government's interests in achieving economy and efficiency in
Federal procurement. The exception shall be based on one or more of the following factors:
(A) The project is of short duration and lacks operational complexity.
(B) The project will involve only one craft or trade.
(C) The project will involve specialized construction work that is available from only a limited number of contractors or subcontractors.
(D) The agency's need for the project is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that a project labor agreement would be impracticable.
(ii) Market research indicates that requiring a project labor agreement on the project would substantially reduce the number of potential offerors to
such a degree that adequate competition at a fair and reasonable price could not be achieved. (See 10.002(b)(1) and 36.104). A likely reduction in the
number of potential offerors is not, by itself, sufficient to except a contract from coverage under this authority unless it is coupled with the finding that
the reduction would not allow for adequate competition at a fair and reasonable price.
(iii) Requiring a project labor agreement on the project would otherwise be inconsistent with Federal statutes, regulations, Executive orders, or
Presidential memoranda.
(2) Considerations. When determining whether the exception in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section applies, contracting officers shall consider current
market conditions and the extent to which price fluctuations may be attributable to factors other than the requirement for a project labor agreement ( e.
g., costs of labor or materials, supply chain costs). Agencies may rely on price analysis conducted on recent competitive proposals for construction
projects of a similar size and scope.
(3) Timing of the exception --
(i) Contracts other than IDIQ contracts. The exception must be granted for a particular contract by the solicitation date.
(ii) IDIQ contracts. An exception shall be granted prior to the solicitation date if the basis for the exception cited would apply to all orders. Otherwise,
exceptions shall be granted for each order by the time of the notice of the intent to place an order ( e.g., 16.505(b)(1)).

work and that are produced as complete systems, are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the individual
parts or components of those systems are delivered to the construction site. Materials purchased directly by the Government are supplies, not
construction material.
Cost of components means-
(1) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the construction
material (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or
(2) For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of the component, including transportation costs as
described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs
associated with the manufacture of the construction material.
Critical component means a component that is mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States and deemed critical to the U.S. supply chain.
The list of critical components is at FAR 25.105.
Critical item means a domestic construction material or domestic end product that is deemed critical to U.S. supply chain resiliency. The list of
critical items is at FAR 25.105.
Designated country means any of the following countries:
(1) A World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement (WTO GPA) country (Armenia, Aruba, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria,
Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy,
Japan, Korea (Republic of), Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Zealand, North
Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Ukraine, or United
00 72 00-7
Kingdom);
(2) A Free Trade Agreement (FTA) country (Australia, Bahrain, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras, Korea (Republic of), Mexico, Morocco, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama, Peru, or Singapore);

Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, Saba, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, or
Trinidad and Tobago).
Designated country construction material means a construction material that is a WTO GPA country construction material, an FTA country
construction material, a least developed country construction material, or a Caribbean Basin country construction material.
Domestic construction material means-
(1) For construction material that does not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both-
(i) An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States; or
(ii) A construction material manufactured in the United States, if-
(A) The cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 60 percent of the cost of all its components, except
that the percentage will be 65 percent for items delivered in calendar years 2024 through 2028 and 75 percent for items delivered starting in calendar
year 2029.
(B) The construction material is a COTS item; or
(2) For construction material that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, a construction material manufactured in
the United States if the cost of foreign iron and steel constitutes less than 5 percent of the cost of all components used in such construction material.
The cost of foreign iron and steel includes but is not limited to the cost of foreign iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or
sheet), castings, or forgings utilized in the manufacture of the construction material and a good faith estimate of the cost of all foreign iron or steel
components excluding COTS fasteners. Iron or steel components of unknown origin are treated as foreign. If the construction material contains
multiple components, the cost of all the materials used in such construction material is calculated in accordance with the definition of "cost of
components".
Fastener means a hardware device that mechanically joins or affixes two or more objects together. Examples of fasteners are nuts, bolts, pins, rivets,
nails, clips, and screws.
Foreign construction material means a construction material other than a domestic construction material.
Foreign iron and steel means iron or steel products not produced in the United States. Produced in the United States means that all manufacturing
processes of the iron or steel must take place in the United States, from the initial melting stage through the application of coatings, except
metallurgical processes involving refinement of steel additives. The origin of the elements of the iron or steel is not relevant to the determination of
whether it is domestic or foreign.
Free Trade Agreement country construction material means a construction material that-
(1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) country; or
(2) In the case of a construction material that consists in whole or in part of materials from another country, has been substantially transformed in a
FTA country into a new and different construction material distinct from the materials from which it was transformed.
Least developed country construction material means a construction material that-
(1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a least developed country; or
(2) In the case of a construction material that consists in whole or in part of materials from another country, has been substantially transformed in a
least developed country into a new and different construction material distinct from the materials from which it was transformed.
Predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both means that the cost of the iron and steel content exceeds 50 percent of the total cost of all its
components. The cost of iron and steel is the cost of the iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings
utilized in the manufacture of the product and a good faith estimate of the cost of iron or steel components excluding COTS fasteners.
00 72 00-8
Steel means an alloy that includes at least 50 percent iron, between 0.02 and 2 percent carbon, and may include other elements.
United States means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas.
WTO GPA country construction material means a construction material that-
(1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a WTO GPA country; or
(2) In the case of a construction material that consists in whole or in part of materials from another country, has been substantially transformed in a
WTO GPA country into a new and different construction material distinct from the materials from which it was transformed.
(b) Construction materials.
(1) This clause implements 41 U.S.C.chapter 83, Buy American, by providing a preference for domestic construction material. In accordance with 41
U.S.C.1907, the domestic content test of the Buy American statute is waived for construction material that is a COTS item, except that for
construction material that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, the domestic content test is applied only to the
iron and steel content of the construction material, excluding COTS fasteners. (See FAR 12.505(a)(2)). In addition, the Contracting Officer has
determined that the WTO GPA and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) apply to this acquisition. Therefore, the Buy American restrictions are waived for
designated country construction materials.
(2) The Contractor shall use only domestic or designated country construction material in performing this contract, except as provided in paragraphs
(b)(3) and (b)(4) of this clause.
(3) The requirement in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause does not apply to information technology that is a commercial product or to the construction
materials or components listed by the Government as follows:
____________[Contracting Officer to list applicable excepted materials or indicate "none"]
(4) The Contracting Officer may add other foreign construction material to the list in paragraph (b)(3) of this clause if the Government determines
that-
(i) The cost of domestic construction material would be unreasonable.
(A) For domestic construction material that is not a critical item or does not contain critical components.
(1) The cost of a particular domestic construction material subject to the restrictions of the Buy American statute is unreasonable when the cost of
such material exceeds the cost of foreign material by more than 20 percent;
(2) For construction material that is not a COTS item and does not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, if the
cost of a particular domestic construction material is determined to be unreasonable or there is no domestic offer received, and the low offer is for
foreign construction material that does not exceed 55 percent domestic content, the Contracting Officer will treat the lowest offer of foreign
construction material that is manufactured in the United States and exceeds 55 percent domestic content as a domestic offer and determine whether
the cost of that offer is unreasonable by applying the evaluation factor listed in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A)(1) of this clause.
(3) The procedures in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A)(2) of this clause will no longer apply as of January 1, 2030.
(B) For domestic construction material that is a critical item or contains critical components.
(1) The cost of a particular domestic construction material that is a critical item or contains critical components, subject to the requirements of the Buy
American statute, is unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the cost of foreign material by more than 20 percent plus the additional
preference factor identified for the critical item or construction material containing critical components listed at FAR 25.105.
(2) For construction material that does not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, if the cost of a particular
domestic construction material is determined to be unreasonable or there is no domestic offer received, and the low offer is for foreign construction
material that does not exceed 55 percent domestic content, the Contracting Officer will treat the lowest offer of foreign construction material that is
manufactured in the United States and exceeds 55 percent domestic content as a domestic offer, and determine whether the cost of that offer is
unreasonable by applying the evaluation factor listed in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B)(1) of this clause.
(3) The procedures in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B)(2) of this clause will no longer apply as of January 1, 2030.
(ii) The application of the restriction of the Buy American Act to a particular construction material would be impracticable or inconsistent with the
public interest; or
00 72 00-9
(iii) The construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial
quantities of a satisfactory quality.
(c) Request for determination of inapplicability of the Buy American statute.
(1)
(i) Any Contractor request to use foreign construction material in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this clause shall include adequate information
for Government evaluation of the request, including-
(A) A description of the foreign and domestic construction materials;
(B) Unit of measure;
(C) Quantity;
(D) Price;
(E) Time of delivery or availability;
(F) Location of the construction project;
(G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and
(H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign construction materials cited in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause.
(ii) A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market and a completed price comparison table in the format in
paragraph (d) of this clause.
(iii) The price of construction material shall include all delivery costs to the construction site and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free
certificate may be issued).
(iv) Any Contractor request for a determination submitted after contract award shall explain why the Contractor could not reasonably foresee the need
for such determination and could not have requested the determination before contract award. If the Contractor does not submit a satisfactory
explanation, the Contracting Officer need not make a determination.
(2) If the Government determines after contract award that an exception to the Buy American statute applies and the Contracting Officer and the
Contractor negotiate adequate consideration, the Contracting Officer will modify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material.
However, when the basis for the exception is the unreasonable price of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is not less than the
differential established in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this clause.
(3) Unless the Government determines that an exception to the Buy American statute applies, use of foreign construction material is noncompliant
with the Buy American statute.
(d) Data. To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (c) of this clause based on unreasonable cost, the Contractor shall include the following
information and any applicable supporting data based on the survey of suppliers:

 Foreign and Domestic Construction Materials Price Comparison
 Construction Material Description Unit of Measure Quantity Price (Dollars)*
 Item1
 Foreign construction material ____ ____ ____
 Domestic construction material ____ ____ ____

52.232-5 Payments under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts. (May 2014)
Payments under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts (May 2014)
 (a) Payment of price. The Government shall pay the Contractor the contract price as provided in this contract.
00 72 00-10
 (b) Progress payments. The Government shall make progress payments monthly as the work proceeds, or at more frequent intervals as determined by
the Contracting Officer, on estimates of work accomplished which meets the standards of quality established under the contract, as approved by the
Contracting Officer.
 (1) The Contractor's request for progress payments shall include the following substantiation:
 (i) An itemization of the amounts requested, related to the various elements of work required by the contract covered by the payment requested.
 (ii) A listing of the amount included for work performed by each subcontractor under the contract.
 (iii) A listing of the total amount of each subcontract under the contract.
 (iv) A listing of the amounts previously paid to each such subcontractor under the contract.
 (v) Additional supporting data in a form and detail required by the Contracting Officer.
 (2) In the preparation of estimates, the Contracting Officer may authorize material delivered on the site and preparatory work done to be taken into
consideration. Material delivered to the Contractor at locations other than the site also may be taken into consideration if-
 (i) Consideration is specifically authorized by this contract; and
 (ii) The Contractor furnishes satisfactory evidence that it has acquired title to such material and that the material will be used to perform this contract.
 (c) Contractor certification. Along with each request for progress payments, the Contractor shall furnish the following certification, or payment shall
not be made: (However, if the Contractor elects to delete paragraph (c)(4) from the certification, the certification is still acceptable.)
I hereby certify, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that-
(1) The amounts requested are only for performance in accordance with the specifications, terms, and conditions of the contract;
(2) All payments due to subcontractors and suppliers from previous payments received under the contract have been made, and timely payments will
be made from the proceeds of the payment covered by this certification, in accordance with subcontract agreements and the requirements of Chapter
39 of Title 31, United States Code;
(3) This request for progress payments does not include any amounts which the prime contractor intends to withhold or retain from a subcontractor or
supplier in accordance with the terms and conditions of the subcontract; and
(4) This certification is not to be construed as final acceptance of a subcontractor's performance.
____ (Name)
____ (Title)
____ (Date)
 (d) Refund of unearned amounts. If the Contractor, after making a certified request for progress payments, discovers that a portion or all of such
request constitutes a payment for performance by the Contractor that fails to conform to the specifications, terms, and conditions of this contract
(hereinafter referred to as the "unearned amount"), the Contractor shall-
 (1) Notify the Contracting Officer of such performance deficiency; and
 (2) Be obligated to pay the Government an amount (computed by the Contracting Officer in the manner provided in paragraph (j) of this clause)
equal to interest on the unearned amount from the 8 thday after the date of receipt of the unearned amount until-
 (i) The date the Contractor notifies the Contracting Officer that the performance deficiency has been corrected; or
 (ii) The date the Contractor reduces the amount of any subsequent certified request for progress payments by an amount equal to the unearned
amount.
 (e) Retainage. If the Contracting Officer finds that satisfactory progress was achieved during any period for which a progress payment is to be made,
the Contracting Officer shall authorize payment to be made in full. However, if satisfactory progress has not been made, the Contracting Officer may
retain a maximum of 10 percent of the amount of the payment until satisfactory progress is achieved. When the work is substantially complete, the
Contracting Officer may retain from previously withheld funds and future progress payments that amount the Contracting Officer considers adequate
for protection of the Government and shall release to the Contractor all the remaining withheld funds. Also, on completion and acceptance of each
separate building, public work, or other division of the contract, for which the price is stated separately in the contract, payment shall be made for the
completed work without retention of a percentage.
 (f) Title, liability, and reservation of rights. All material and work covered by progress payments made shall, at the time of payment, become the sole
property of the Government, but this shall not be construed as-
 (1) Relieving the Contractor from the sole responsibility for all material and work upon which payments have been made or the restoration of any
00 72 00-11
damaged work; or
 (2) Waiving the right of the Government to require the fulfillment of all of the terms of the contract.
 (g) Reimbursement for bond premiums. In making these progress payments, the Government shall, upon request, reimburse the Contractor for the
amount of premiums paid for performance and payment bonds (including coinsurance and reinsurance agreements, when applicable) after the
Contractor has furnished evidence of full payment to the surety. The retainage provisions in paragraph (e) of this clause shall not apply to that portion
of progress payments attributable to bond premiums.
 (h) Final payment. The Government shall pay the amount due the Contractor under this contract after-
 (1) Completion and acceptance of all work;
 (2) Presentation of a properly executed voucher; and
 (3) Presentation of release of all claims against the Government arising by virtue of this contract, other than claims, in stated amounts, that the
Contractor has specifically excepted from the operation of the release. A release may also be required of the assignee if the Contractor's claim to
amounts payable under this contract has been assigned under the Assignment of Claims Act of1940 (31 U.S.C.3727 and 41 U.S.C.6305).
 (i) Limitation because of undefinitized work. Notwithstanding any provision of this contract, progress payments shall not exceed 80 percent on work
accomplished on undefinitized contract actions. A "contract action" is any action resulting in a contract, as defined in FAR subpart 2.1, including
contract modifications for additional supplies or services, but not including contract modifications that are within the scope and under the terms of the
contract, such as contract modifications issued pursuant to the Changes clause, or funding and other administrative changes.
 (j) Interest computation on unearned amounts. In accordance with 31 U.S.C.3903(c)(1), the amount payable under paragraph (d)(2) of this clause
shall be-
 (1) Computed at the rate of average bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned at the most recent auction of such bills prior to the date
the Contractor receives the unearned amount; and
 (2) Deducted from the next available payment to the Contractor.

52.248-3 Value Engineering-Construction. (Oct 2025)
Value Engineering-Construction (Oct 2025)
(a) General. The Contractor is encouraged to develop, prepare, and submit value engineering change proposals (VECP's) voluntarily. The Contractor
shall share in any instant contract savings realized from accepted VECP's, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this clause.
(b) Definitions. "Collateral costs," as used in this clause, means agency costs of operation, maintenance, logistic support, or Government-furnished
property.
Collateral savings, as used in this clause, means those measurable net reductions resulting from a VECP in the agency's overall projected collateral
costs, exclusive of acquisition savings, whether or not the acquisition cost changes.
Contractor's development and implementation costs, as used in this clause, means those costs the Contractor incurs on a VECP specifically in
developing, testing, preparing, and submitting the VECP, as well as those costs the Contractor incurs to make the contractual changes required by
Government acceptance of a VECP.
Government costs, as used in this clause, means those agency costs that result directly from developing and implementing the VECP, such as any net
increases in the cost of testing, operations, maintenance, and logistic support. The term does not include the normal administrative costs of processing
the VECP.
Instant contract savings, as used in this clause, means the estimated reduction in Contractor cost of performance resulting from acceptance of the
VECP, minus allowable Contractor's development and implementation costs, including subcontractors' development and implementation costs (see
paragraph (h) of this clause).
Value engineering change proposal (VECP) means a proposal that-
(1) Requires a change to this, the instant contract, to implement; and
(2) Results in reducing the contract price or estimated cost without impairing essential functions or characteristics; provided, that it does not involve a
change-
(i) In deliverable end item quantities only; or
(ii) To the contract type only.
(c) VECP preparation. As a minimum, the Contractor shall include in each VECP the information described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (7) of this
clause. If the proposed change is affected by contractually required configuration management or similar procedures, the instructions in those
procedures relating to format, identification, and priority assignment shall govern VECP preparation. The VECP shall include the following:
(1) A description of the difference between the existing contract requirement and that proposed, the comparative advantages and disadvantages of
each, a justification when an item's function or characteristics are being altered, and the effect of the change on the end item's performance.
(2) A list and analysis of the contract requirements that must be changed if the VECP is accepted, including any suggested specification revisions.
(3) A separate, detailed cost estimate for (i) the affected portions of the existing contract requirement and (ii) the VECP. The cost reduction associated
with the VECP shall take into account the Contractor's allowable development and implementation costs, including any amount attributable to
subcontracts under paragraph (h) of this clause.
(4) A description and estimate of costs the Government may incur in implementing the VECP, such as test and evaluation and operating and support
costs.
(5) A prediction of any effects the proposed change would have on collateral costs to the agency.
(6) A statement of the time by which a contract modification accepting the VECP must be issued in order to achieve the maximum cost reduction,
noting any effect on the contract completion time or delivery schedule.
00 72 00-13
(7) Identification of any previous submissions of the VECP, including the dates submitted, the agencies and contract numbers involved, and previous
Government actions, if known.
(d) Submission. The Contractor shall submit VECP's to the Resident Engineer at the worksite, with a copy to the Contracting Officer.
(e) Government action.
(1) The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor of the status of the VECP within 45 calendar days after the contracting office receives it. If
additional time is required, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor within the 45-day period and provide the reason for the delay and the
expected date of the decision. The Government will process VECP's expeditiously; however, it will not be liable for any delay in acting upon a VECP.
(2) If the VECP is not accepted, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing, explaining the reasons for rejection. The Contractor may
withdraw any VECP, in whole or in part, at any time before it is accepted by the Government. The Contracting Officer may require that the
Contractor provide written notification before undertaking significant expenditures for VECP effort.
(3) Any VECP may be accepted, in whole or in part, by the Contracting Officer's award of a modification to this contract citing this clause. The
Contracting Officer may accept the VECP, even though an agreement on price reduction has not been reached, by issuing the Contractor a notice to
proceed with the change. Until a notice to proceed is issued or a contract modification applies a VECP to this contract, the Contractor shall perform in
accordance with the existing contract. The decision to accept or reject all or part of any VECP is a unilateral decision made solely at the discretion of
the Contracting Officer.
(f) Sharing-
(1) Rates. The Government's share of savings is determined by subtracting Government costs from instant contract savings and multiplying the result
by-
(i) 45 percent for fixed-price contracts; or
(ii) 75 percent for cost-reimbursement contracts.
(2) Payment. Payment of any share due the Contractor for use of a VECP on this contract shall be authorized by a modification to this contract to-
(i) Accept the VECP;
(ii) Reduce the contract price or estimated cost by the amount of instant contract savings; and
(iii) Provide the Contractor's share of savings by adding the amount calculated to the contract price or fee.
(g) Collateral savings. If a VECP is accepted, the Contracting Officer will increase the instant contract amount by 20 percent of any projected
collateral savings determined to be realized in a typical year of use after subtracting any Government costs not previously offset. However, the
Contractor's share of collateral savings will not exceed the contract's firm-fixed-price or estimated cost, at the time the VECP is accepted, or
$100,000, whichever is greater. The Contracting Officer is the sole determiner of the amount of collateral savings.
(h) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include an appropriate value engineering clause in any subcontract of $90,000 or more and may include one in
subcontracts of lesser value. In computing any adjustment in this contract's price under paragraph (f) of this clause, the Contractor's allowable
development and implementation costs shall include any subcontractor's allowable development and implementation costs clearly resulting from a
VECP accepted by the Government under this contract, but shall exclude any value engineering incentive payments to a subcontractor. The
Contractor may choose any arrangement for subcontractor value engineering incentive payments; provided, that these payments shall not reduce the
Government's share of the savings resulting from the VECP.
(i) Data. The Contractor may restrict the Government's right to use any part of a VECP or the supporting data by marking the following legend on the
affected parts:
These data, furnished under the Value Engineering-Construction clause of contract ____, shall not be disclosed outside the Government or duplicated,
used, or disclosed, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than to evaluate a value engineering change proposal submitted under the clause. This
restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in these data if it has been obtained or is otherwise available from the
Contractor or from another source without limitations.
If a VECP is accepted, the Contractor hereby grants the Government unlimited rights in the VECP and supporting data, except that, with respect to
data qualifying and submitted as limited rights technical data, the Government shall have the rights specified in the contract modification
implementing the VECP and shall appropriately mark the data. (The terms "unlimited rights" and "limited rights" are defined in part 27 of the Federal
Acquisition Regulation.)

1.10 PARTNERING
a. The Government intends to encourage the foundation of a cohesive
partnership with the Contractor and its subcontractors. This
partnership will be structured to draw on the strengths of each
organization to identify and achieve reciprocal goals. Among the
objectives are effective and efficient Contract performance and are
intended to achieve completion within budget, on schedule, and in
accordance with the plans and specifications; and to develop a single
cooperative management team focused on the success of the project to
mutual benefit of all stakeholders. This partnership will be bilateral
in makeup, and participation will be totally voluntary. Any cost
associated with effectuating this partnership will be agreed to by both
parties, and will be shared equally with no change to the Contract
price. An integral aspect of partnering is the resolution of disputes
in a timely, professional, and non-adversarial manner through the use
of issue clarification and problem solving. Alternate Dispute
Resolution (ADR) methodologies will be encouraged in place of the more
formal dispute resolution procedures. ADR will assist in promoting and
maintaining an amicable working relationship to preserve the
partnership. ADR is a voluntary, non-binding procedure available for
SECTION 01 10 00.00 25 Page 7
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
use by the parties to this Contract to resolve any dispute that may
arise during performance.
b. Should the Contractor elect to participate in partnering, key
on-site and home office management personnel will be required to attend
a full day partnering session as directed by the Government with an
outside facilitator. The cost of this facilitated session is
anticipated to be around $5,000 and will be shared equally between the
Contractor and the Government.
1.11 FACILITY TURNOVER PLANNING MEETINGS (Red Zone Meetings)
Meet with the Government to identify strategies to ensure the project is
carried to expeditious closure and turnover to the Client. Start planning
the turnover process at the Pre-Construction Conference meeting with a
discussion of the Red Zone process and convene at regularly scheduled Red
Zone Meetings beginning at approximately 75 percent of project completion.
Include the following in the turnover effort:
1.11.1 Red Zone Checklist
a. CO will provide the Contractor a copy of the Red Zone Checklist
template.
b. Prior to 75 percent completion, modify the Red Zone Checklist
template by adding or deleting critical activities applicable to the
project and assign planned completion dates for each activity. Submit
the modified Red Zone Checklist to the CO. The CO may request
additional activities be added to the Red Zone Checklist at any time as
necessary.
1.11.2 Meetings
a. Conduct regular Red Zone Meetings beginning at approximately 75
percent project completion, or three to six months prior to Beneficial
Occupancy Date (BOD), whichever comes first.
b. The CO will establish the frequency of the meetings, which is
expected to increase as the project completion draws nearer. At the
beginning, Red Zone meetings may be every two weeks then increase to
weekly towards the final month of the project.
c. Using the Red Zone Checklist as a Plan of Action and Milestones
(POAM) and basis for discussion, review upcoming critical activities
and strategies to ensure work is completed on time.
d. During the Red Zone Meetings discuss with the CO any upcoming
activities that require Government involvement.
e. Maintain the Red Zone Checklist by documenting the actual completion
dates as work is completed and update the Red Zone Checklist with
revised planned completion dates as necessary to match progress.
Distribute copies of the current Red Zone Checklist to attendees at
each Red Zone Meeting.
1.12 EQUIPMENT OWNERSHIP AND OPERATING EXPENSE SCHEDULE
a. This special Contract requirement does not apply to terminations.
See FAR Part 49.
SECTION 01 10 00.00 25 Page 8
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
b. Allowable cost for construction and marine plant and equipment in
sound workable condition owned or controlled and furnished by a
Contractor or subcontractor at any tier must be based on actual cost
data for each piece of equipment or groups of similar serial and series
for which the Government can determine both ownership and operating
costs from the Contractor's accounting records. When both ownership
and operating costs cannot be determined for any piece of equipment or
groups of similar serial or series equipment from the Contractor's
accounting records, costs for that equipment must be based upon the
applicable provisions of EP 1110-1-8, Construction Equipment Ownership
and Operating Expense Schedule, Region VIII. Working conditions must
be considered to be average for determining equipment rates using the
schedule unless specified otherwise by the CO. For equipment not
included in the schedule, rates for comparable pieces of equipment may
be used or a rate may be developed using the formula provided in the
schedule. For forward pricing, the schedule in effect at the time of
negotiations must apply. For retroactive pricing, the schedule in
effect at the time the work was performed must apply.
c. Equipment rental costs are allowable, subject to the provisions of
FAR 31.105(d)(ii) and FAR 31.205-36, Rental Costs. Rates for equipment
rented from an organization under common control, lease-purchase
arrangements, and sale-leaseback arrangements, will be determined using
the schedule, except that actual rates will be used for equipment
leased from an organization under common control that has an
established practice of leasing the same or similar equipment to
unaffiliated lessees.
d. When actual equipment costs are proposed and the total amount of the
pricing action exceeds the SAT, the CO must request the Contractor to
submit either certified cost or pricing data, or partial/limited data,
as appropriate. The data must be submitted on Standard Form 1411,
Contract Pricing Proposal Cover Sheet.
1.13 BASIS FOR SETTLEMENT OF PROPOSALS
a. Actual costs will be used to determine equipment costs for a
settlement proposal submitted on the total cost basis.
b. In evaluating a termination settlement proposal using the total cost
basis, the following principles will be applied to determine allowable
equipment costs:
(1) Actual costs for each piece of equipment, or groups of similar
serial or series equipment, need not be available in the
Contractor's accounting records to determine total actual
equipment costs.
(2) If equipment costs have been allocated to a Contract using
predetermined rates, those charges will be adjusted to actual
costs.
(3) Recorded job costs adjusted for unallowable expenses will be
used to determine equipment operating expenses.
(4) Ownership costs (depreciation) will be determined using the
Contractor's depreciation schedule (subject to the provisions of
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 31.205-11).
SECTION 01 10 00.00 25 Page 9
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
(5) License, taxes, storage and insurance costs are normally
recovered as an indirect expense and unless the Contractor charges
these costs directly to Contracts, they will be recovered through
the indirect expense rate.

The Government has established periods, described as "in-water work
periods," coinciding with the annual cycles of fish migration and related
allowed maintenance periods. In general, this is a work period that allows
for work in the water, on the water, and adjacent to the water where the
work might affect fish passage. The in-water work (IWW) period established
for this Contract is: July 1 to October 4. All in-water work must be
completed during the IWW period and the dates indicated.
1.4.2 In-Water Work Activities
For purposes of this Contract, work items that must be restricted to the
in-water work window (IWW) period, along with further work restrictions,
are described below:
The IWW applies to work below the ordinary high-water mark
(OHWM). OHWM is considered to be the top of channel and is
confined to the low flow channel in the existing RCC spillway.
Any areas with established vegetation and sediment deposits are
above the OHWM. Normal construction activities are permitted
above the OHWM with the exception of the placement of staging
areas and storage of fuel or other chemicals that could adversely
affect the water.
The river diversion structure cannot remain in place outside of
the IWW. Comply with the Washington Department of Ecology (DOE)
Water Quality Certificate, included as an attachment containing

PROJECT SCHEDULE
PART 1 GENERAL
1.1 REFERENCES
The publications listed below form a part of this Specification to the
extent referenced. The publications are referred to within the text by the
basic designation only.
U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS (USACE)
ER 1-1-11 (2017) Administration -- Project Schedules
1.2 SUBMITTALS
Government approval is required for submittals with a "G" designation;
submittals not having a "G" designation are for information only. When
used, a designation following the "G" designation identifies the office
that will review the submittal for the Government. Submit the following in
accordance with Section 01 33 00, SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES:
SD-01 Preconstruction Submittals
Preliminary Schedule; G ECCC
Initial Schedule; G ECCC
1.3 QUALITY CONTROL
Designate an authorized representative who must be responsible for the
preparation of the schedule and all required updating (activity status) and
preparation of reports. The authorized representative must be experienced
in scheduling projects similar in nature and complexity to this project and
must be experienced in the use of the scheduling software that meets the
requirements of this specification.
1.4 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
a. Prepare for approval a Project Schedule, as described herein,
pursuant to FAR 52.236-15, SCHEDULES FOR CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS. Show
in the schedule the sequence in which the Contractor proposes to
perform the work and dates on which the Contractor contemplates
starting and completing all schedule activities. The scheduling of the
entire project is required. Scheduling of construction are the
responsibility of the Contractor. Contractor management personnel must
actively participate in its development. Subcontractors and suppliers
working on the project must also contribute in developing and
maintaining an accurate Project Schedule. Coordinate with other
Contractor's work at or near the site of the work under this Contract
in accordance with FAR 52.236-8, OTHER CONTRACTS.
b. The approved Project Schedule must be used to measure the progress
of the work, to aid in evaluating time extensions, and to provide the
SECTION 01 32 01.00 25 Page 3
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
basis of all progress payments.
1.5 BASIS FOR PAYMENT AND COST LOADING
Use the schedule as the basis for determining Contract earnings during each
update period and therefore the amount of each progress payment. Lack of
an approved schedule update, or qualified scheduling personnel, will result
in the inability of the Contracting Officer (CO) to evaluate Contractor's
progress for the purposes of payment. Failure of the Contractor to provide
all required information will result in the disapproval of the preliminary,
initial, and subsequent schedule updates. In the event schedule revisions
have been directed by the CO and those revisions have not been included in
subsequent revisions or updates, the CO may hold retainage up to the
maximum allowed by Contract, each payment period, until such revisions to
the Project Schedule have been made. Activity cost loading must be
reasonable, as determined by the CO. The aggregate value of all activities
coded to a Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) must equal the value of the
CLIN on the Schedule.
1.6 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
The schedule must be compatible with Primavera P6 Professional v16.2.
1.6.1 Critical Path Method
Use the Critical Path Method (CPM) of network calculation to generate the
Project Schedule. Prepare the Project Schedule using the Precedence
Diagram Method (PDM).
1.6.2 Milestones
Include milestone activities for each significant project event including
but not limited to: Notice to Proceed (NTP), contractually required work
windows, river diversion in place, foundation/substructure construction
complete, superstructure construction complete, RCC construction complete,
construction complete, and Contract complete.
1.6.3 Level of Detail Required
Include an appropriate level of detail in the Project Schedule. Failure to
develop or update the Project Schedule or provide data at the appropriate
level of detail, as determined by the CO, will result in its disapproval.
The CO will consider, but is not limited to, the following characteristics
and requirements to determine the appropriate level of detail:
1.6.3.1 Activity Durations
Submissions must follow the direction of the CO regarding reasonable
activity durations. Reasonable durations are those that allow the progress
of activities to be accurately determined between payment periods.
Procurement activities are defined herein. Less than two percent of all
non-procurement activities must have Original Durations (OD) greater than
20 work days or 30 calendar days.
1.6.3.2 Procurement Activities
Include activities associated with the submittal, approval, procurement,
fabrication and delivery of long lead materials, equipment, fabricated
assemblies, and supplies. Long lead materials and equipment are those
SECTION 01 32 01.00 25 Page 4
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
materials that have a procurement cycle of over 90 calendar days. A
typical procurement sequence includes the string of activities: submit,
approve, procure, fabricate, and deliver.
1.6.3.3 Critical Activities
The following must be included and properly scheduled:
a. Critical path activities.
b. Activities that fall within one week of critical path activities.
c. Mix design activities, mob/calibration of batch plant and placement
of RCC completion prior to the end of IWW window.
d. Submission and approval of Record (As-built) drawings.
e. Submission and approval of all required testing.
f. Contractor's punch-out inspection.
g. Correction of punchlist from Contractor's punch-out inspection.
h. Government's pre-final inspection.
i. Correction of punch list from Government's pre-final inspection.
j. Final acceptance inspection.
1.6.3.4 Government Activities
Government and other agency activities that could impact progress must be
shown. These activities include, but are not limited to: submittal
reviews, approvals, environmental permit approvals, inspections,
lockout/tagout procedures, utility tie-in, Government-Furnished Equipment
(GFE), and NTP for phasing requirements.
1.6.3.5 Responsibility
Identify all activities in the Project Schedule by the party responsible to
perform the work. Responsibility includes, but is not limited to: the
subcontractor, the Prime Contractor, or Government agency performing a
given task. The responsible party for each activity must be identified by
the Responsibility Code. Activities must not have more than one
Responsibility Code.
1.6.3.6 Work Areas
Identify all activities in the Project Schedule by the work area in which
the activity occurs. Activities must not be allowed to cover more than one
work area. Define work areas based on resource constraints or space
constraints that would preclude a resource, such as a particular trade or
craft work crew, from working in more than one work area at a time due to
restraints on resources or space. The work area of each activity must be
identified by the Work Area Code and activities must not have more than one
Work Area Code.
SECTION 01 32 01.00 25 Page 5
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
1.6.3.7 Contract Line Item Number (CLIN)
Code all activities to the CLIN on the Contract Line Item Schedule to which
the activity belongs. CLIN Item code all activities, even when an activity
is not cost loaded. An activity must not contain more than one CLIN Item
Code.
1.6.3.8 Phase of Work
Identify all activities in the Project Schedule by the phase of work in
which the activity occurs. Code construction phases proposed by the
Contractor to allow filtering and organizing the schedule by construction
packages. Activities must not contain work in more than one phase of
work. Each activity must be identified with a single project phase and
have only one Phase of Work code.
1.6.3.9 Category of Work
Assign a Category of Work Code to all Activities based upon the category of
work to which the activity belongs. Category of work refers, but is not
limited, to the procurement chain of activities including such items as
construction submittals, approvals, procurement, fabrication, delivery,
weather sensitive installation, non-weather sensitive installation,
start-up, and testing. Assign a Category of Work Code to each activity.
Each activity must have only one Category of Work Code.
1.6.3.10 Definable Features of Work
Assign a Definable Feature of Work Code to appropriate activities based on
the definable feature of work to which the activity belongs. Definable
Feature of Work is defined in Specification Section 01 45 00.00 25, QUALITY
CONTROL. An activity must not have more than one Definable Feature of Work
Code. Not all activities are required to be Definable Feature of Work
Coded.
1.6.3.11 Modification or Claim Number
Assign an Activity code to any activity or sequence of activities added to
the schedule as a result of a Contract Modification, when approved by the
CO. Any activity that is added or changed by Contract modification or used
to justify claimed time must be identified by a Mod or Claim Number that
changed the activity. Activities must not belong to more than one
modification or claim item. Approval to add these activities does not
necessarily mean the Government accepts responsibility and, therefore,
liability for such activities and any associated impacts to the schedule,
but rather the Government recognizes such activities are appropriately
added to the schedule for the purposes of maintaining a realistic and
meaningful schedule. Such activities must not be Responsibility Coded to
the Government unless approved. Existing activities must not normally be
changed to reflect modifications.
1.6.4 Scheduled Project Completion and Activity Calendars
The schedule interval must extend from NTP date to the required final
physical completion and Contract end dates. The Contract completion
activity (End Project) must finish based on the required Contract duration
in the accepted Contract proposal, as adjusted for any approved Contract
time extensions. The first scheduled work period must be the day after NTP
is received by the Contractor. Schedule activities on a calendar to which
SECTION 01 32 01.00 25 Page 6
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
the activity logically belongs. Activities may be assigned to a seven day
calendar when the Contract assigns calendar day durations for the activity
such as a Government Acceptance activity. If the Contractor intends to
perform physical work less than seven days per week, schedule the
associated activities on a calendar with non-work periods identified
including weekends and holidays. Assign the Category of Work Code -
Weather Sensitive Installation to those activities that are weather
sensitive. Original durations must account for anticipated normal adverse
weather. The Government will interpret all work periods not identified as
non-work periods on each calendar as meaning the Contractor intends to
perform work during those periods.
1.6.4.1 Project Start Date
Start the schedule no earlier than the date on which the NTP was
acknowledged. Include as the first activity in the Project Schedule an
activity called "Start Project". The "Start Project" activity must have an
early start "ES" constraint date, equal to the date that the NTP was
acknowledged, and a zero day duration.
1.6.4.2 Constraint of Last Activity
Completion of the last physical activity in the schedule must be
constrained by final construction physical completion date. Submission and
acceptance of the last transmittal in the schedule must be constrained by
the Contract end date. Schedule calculations must result in a negative
float when the calculated early finish date of the last activity is later
than the Contract end date. Include as the last activity in the Project
Schedule an activity called "End Project". The "End Project" activity must
have a late finish "LF" constraint date equal to the Contract end date for
the project, and a zero day duration or by using the "project must finish
by" date in the scheduling software. The schedule must have no constrained
dates other than those specified in the Contract. There must only be two
open ended activities: Start Project (or NTP) with no predecessor logic
and End Project with no successor logic.
1.6.4.3 Early Project Completion
In the event the Project Schedule shows completion of the project prior to
the final construction physical completion or Contract end date, identify
those activities that it intends to accelerate or those activities that are
scheduled in parallel to support the Contractor's "early" completion.
Specifically address each of the activities noted in the narrative report
at every Project Schedule update period to assist the CO in evaluating the
Contractor's ability to actually complete prior to the Contract period.
The last activity must have a late finish constraint equal to the Contract
end date and the schedule must calculate positive float. The Government
will not approve an early completion schedule with zero float on the
longest path. The Government is under no obligation to accelerate
activities for which it is responsible to support a proposed early Contract
completion.
1.6.5 Interim Completion Dates
Contractually specified interim construction completion dates must be
constrained to show negative float if the early finish date of the last
activity in that phase falls after the interim construction completion date.
SECTION 01 32 01.00 25 Page 7
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
1.6.5.1 Start Phase
Include as the first activity for a project phase an activity called "Start
Phase X" where "X" refers to the phase of work. The "Start Phase X"
activity must have an "ES" constraint date equal to the date on which the
NTP was acknowledged, and a zero day duration.
1.6.5.2 End Phase
Include as the last activity in a project phase an activity called "End
Phase X" where "X" refers to the phase of work. The "End Phase X" activity
must have an "LF" constraint date equal to the date on which the NTP was
acknowledged, and a zero day duration.
1.6.5.3 Phase "X" Hammock
Include a hammock type activity for each project phase called "Phase X"
where "X" refers to the phase of work. The "Phase X" activity must be
logically tied to the earliest and latest activities in the phase.
1.6.6 Default Progress Data Disallowed
Actual Start and Finish dates must not be automatically updated by default
mechanisms that may be included in the scheduling software systems. Actual
Start (AS) and Actual Finish (AF) dates assigned during the updating
process must match those dates provided from Contractor Quality Control
Reports. Failure of the Contractor to document the AS and AF dates on the
Daily Quality Control Report for every in-progress or completed activity,
and failure to ensure that the data contained on the Daily Quality Control
reports is the sole basis for schedule updating must result in the
disapproval of the Contractor's schedule and the inability of the CO to
evaluate Contractor progress for payment purposes. Updating of the percent
complete and the remaining duration of any activity must be independent
functions. Program features which calculate one of these parameters from
the other must be disabled.
1.6.7 Out-of-Sequence Progress
Activities that have progressed before all preceding logic has been
satisfied (Out-of-Sequence Progress) will be allowed only on a case-by-case
basis subject to approval by the CO. Propose logic corrections to
eliminate all out of sequence progress or justify not changing the
sequencing for approval prior to submitting an updated Project Schedule.
Correct out of sequence progress that continues for more than two update
cycles by logic revision, as approved by the CO.
1.6.8 Negative Lags and Start to Finish Relationships
Lag durations contained in the Project Schedule must not have a negative
value. Do not use Start to Finish (SF) relationships.
1.6.9 Calculation Mode
Schedule calculations must retain the logic between predecessors and
successors even when the successor activity starts and the predecessor
activity has not finished. Software features that in effect sever the tie
between predecessor and successor activities when the successor has started
and the predecessor logic is not satisfied ("progress override") will not
be allowed.
SECTION 01 32 01.00 25 Page 8
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
1.7 SUBMISSIONS
Provide the submissions as described below. The data, reports, and network
diagrams required for each submission must be in accordance with Paragraph
entitled SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.
1.7.1 Preliminary Schedule
Submit the Preliminary Schedule, defining the Contractor's planned
operations for the first 90 calendar days, for approval within 15 calendar
days after the NTP is acknowledged. The approved preliminary schedule must
be used for payment purposes not to exceed 90 calendar days after NTP.
Completely cost load the Preliminary Schedule to balance the Contract award
CLINs shown on the Price Schedule. Detail it for the first 90 calendar
days after NTP. It may be summary in nature for the remaining performance
period. It must be early start and late finish constrained and logically
tied as previously specified. The Preliminary Schedule forms the basis for
the Initial Schedule specified herein and must include all of the required
submissions and approvals identified in the Contract (for example, Quality
Control Plan, Safety Plan, and Environmental Protection Plan), other
construction, and non-construction activities intended to occur within the
first 90 calendar days after NTP.
1.7.2 Initial Schedule
a. Submit the Initial Schedule for approval within 30 calendar days
after NTP. Provide a reasonable and realistic sequence of activities
which represent all work through the entire Contract performance
period. The Initial Schedule must be at a reasonable level of detail
as determined by the CO.
b. Periodic Schedule Updates - Based on the result of progress
meetings, specified in Paragraph entitled PERIODIC PROGRESS MEETINGS,
submit periodic schedule updates. These submissions will enable the CO
to assess Contractor's progress. If the Contractor fails or refuses to
furnish the information and Project Schedule data, which in the
judgment of the CO is necessary for verifying the Contractor's
progress, the Contractor must be deemed not to have provided an
estimate upon which progress payment may be made.
1.7.3 Standard Activity Coding Dictionary
Use the activity coding structure defined in the Standard Data Exchange
Format (SDEF) in ER 1-1-11, Appendix A. This exact structure is mandatory,
even if some fields are not used. A template SDEF compatible schedule

the COR. Name files indicating the type of schedule: (Preliminary, Initial,
or Update), Contract number, and Data Date.
1.8.2 Narrative Report
Provide a Narrative Report with the preliminary, initial, and each update
of the Project Schedule, as the basis of the Contractor's progress payment
request. Include: a description of activities along the two most critical
paths, a description of current and anticipated problem areas or delaying
factors and their impact, and an explanation of corrective actions taken or
required to be taken. The narrative report is expected to communicate to
the Government the Contractor's thorough analysis of the schedule output
and its plans to compensate for any problems, either current or potential,
which are revealed through that analysis. Identify and explain why any
activities that, based on their calculated late dates, should have either
started or finished during the update period, but did not.
1.8.3 Approved Changes Verification
Include only those project schedule changes in the schedule submission that
have been previously approved by the CO. Specifically reference, on an
activity by activity basis, all changes made since the previous period and
relate each change to documented, approved schedule changes.
1.8.4 Schedule Reports
The format for each activity for the schedule reports listed below must
contain: Activity Numbers, Activity Description, Original Duration,
Remaining Duration, Early Start Date, Early Finish Date, Late Start Date,

NTP to the data date. This report must reflect the Earnings of specific
activities based on the agreements made in the field and approved between
the Contractor and CO at the most recent Monthly Progress Meeting.
Provided that the Contractor has provided a complete schedule update, this
report must serve as the basis of determining Contractor progress
payments. Group activities by CLIN and sorted by activity numbers. This
report must: sum all activities coded to a particular CLIN and provide a
CLIN item percent earned value, and complete and sum all CLIN items to
provide a total project percent complete. Printed report must contain, for
each activity: the Activity Number, Activity Description, Original
Budgeted Amount, Total Quantity, Quantity to Date, Percent Complete (based
on cost), and Earnings to Date.
1.8.5 Gantt Chart
The Gantt Chart is required for the Preliminary, Initial, and Periodic
Updates. Depict and display the order and interdependence of activities
and the sequence in which the work is to be accomplished. The CO will use,
but is not limited to, the following conditions to review compliance with
this Paragraph:
1.8.5.1 Continuous Flow
Diagrams must show a continuous flow from left to right with no arrows from
right to left. Show the activity number, description, duration, and
estimated earned value on the diagram.
1.8.5.2 Project Milestone Dates
Show dates on the diagram for start of project, any Contract required
interim completion dates, and final construction physical completion and

activity sequence. Typically, this flow will group activities by category
of work, work area, and responsibility.
1.8.5.5 S-Curves
Show earnings curves for projected early and late earnings and earnings to
date.
1.9 PERIODIC PROGRESS MEETINGS
Progress meetings to discuss payment must include a monthly onsite meeting
or other regular intervals as determined by CO. During this meeting
describe, on an activity by activity basis, all proposed revisions and
adjustments to the Project Schedule required to reflect the current status
of the project. The CO will approve activity progress, proposed revisions,
and adjustments as appropriate. The Contractor's Project Manager and
Authorized Scheduler must attend the meeting with the CO.
1.9.1 Update Submission Following Progress Meeting
If required by the CO, submit a schedule update, not later than four
working days after the monthly progress meeting. Include a complete update
of the Project Schedule containing all approved progress, revisions, and
adjustments, based on the regular progress meeting, reflecting only those
changes made during the previous update meeting.
1.9.2 Status of Activities
Update information, including Actual Start (AS) Dates, Actual Finish (AF)
Dates, Remaining Durations (RD), and Percent Complete will be subject to
the approval of the CO. As a minimum, address the following items on an
activity by activity basis during each progress meeting:
1.9.2.1 Start and Finish Dates
Accurately show the status of the Actual Start (AS) and Actual Finish (AF)
dates for each activity currently in-progress or completed since the last
update. Only assign AS dates when actual progress occurs on an activity.
1.9.2.2 Remaining Duration
Update the estimated Remaining Duration for each activity in-progress.
Base time-based progress calculations on Remaining Duration for each
activity.
1.9.2.3 Cost Completion
Update the earnings for each activity started. Payment will be based on
earnings for each in-progress or completed activity. Payment for
individual activities will not be made for work that contains quality
defects. A portion of the overall project amount may be retained based on
delays of activities.
SECTION 01 32 01.00 25 Page 12
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
1.9.2.4 Percent Complete
Update the percent complete for each activity started based on the
realistic assessment of earned value. Activities which are complete except
for remaining minor punch list work and which do not restrain the
initiation of successor activities may be declared 100 percent complete.
1.9.2.5 Logic Changes
Specifically identify and discuss all logic changes pertaining to NTP on
change orders, change orders to be incorporated into the schedule,
Contractor proposed changes in work sequence, corrections to schedule logic
for out-of-sequence progress, lag durations, and other changes that have
been made pursuant to Contract provisions. The Government will only
approve logic revisions for the purpose of keeping the schedule valid in
terms of its usefulness in calculating a realistic completion date,
correcting erroneous logic ties, and accurately sequencing the work.
1.9.2.6 Other Changes
Other changes required due to delays in completion of any activity or group
of activities include:
a. Delays beyond the Contractor's control, such as strikes and unusual
weather.
b. Delays encountered due to submittals, Government Activities,
deliveries, or work stoppages which make re-planning the work necessary.
c. Changes required to correct a schedule which does not represent the
actual or planned prosecution and progress of the work.
1.10 REQUESTS FOR TIME EXTENSIONS
In the event the Contractor believes it is entitled to an extension of the
Contract performance period, final construction physical completion date,
Contract end date, or any interim milestone date, furnish the following for
a determination by the CO: justification, Project Schedule data, and
supporting evidence as the CO may deem necessary. Submission of proof of
excusable delay, based on revised activity logic, duration, and costs
(updated to the specific date that the delay occurred) is obligatory to any
approvals by the Government. In response to each Request For Proposal
issued by the Government, submit a schedule impact analysis demonstrating
whether or not the change contemplated by the Government impacts the
critical path.
1.10.1 Justification of Delay
The Project Schedule must clearly display that the Contractor has used, in
full, all the float time available for the work involved with this
request. The CO's determination as to the number of allowable days of
Contract extension must be based upon the Project Schedule updates in
effect for the time period in question, and other factual information.
Actual delays that are found to be caused by the Contractor's own actions,
which result in a calculated schedule delay, will not be a cause for a time
extension to the performance period, final construction physical completion
date, Contract end date, or any interim milestone date.
SECTION 01 32 01.00 25 Page 13
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
1.10.2 Extension Submission Requirements
a. Submit a justification for each request for a change in the final
construction physical completion and Contract end dates of less than
two weeks based upon the most recent schedule update at the time of the
NTP or constructive direction issued for the change. Such a request
must be in accordance with the requirements of other appropriate
Contract Clauses and must include, as a minimum:
(1) A list of affected activities, with their associated Project
Schedule activity number.
(2) A brief explanation of the causes of the change.
(3) An analysis of the overall impact of the changes proposed.
(4) A sub-network of the affected area.
b. Identify activities impacted by a unique activity code contained in
the required data file.
1.10.3 Additional Submission Requirements
For any requested time extension of over two weeks, the CO may request an
interim update with revised activities for a specific change request.
Provide this within four days of the CO's request.
1.11 DIRECTED CHANGES
If the NTP is issued for changes prior to settlement of price and time,
submit proposed schedule revisions within seven calendar days of the NTP
being issued. The proposed revisions to the schedule will be approved by
the Government prior to inclusion of those changes within the Project
Schedule. If the Contractor fails to submit the proposed revisions, the CO
may furnish the Contractor with suggested revisions to the Project
Schedule. Include these revisions in the Project Schedule until revisions
are submitted and final changes and impacts have been negotiated. If the
Contractor has any objections to the revisions furnished by the CO, advise
the CO within one week of receipt of the revisions. Regardless of the
objections, continue to update the schedule with the CO's revisions until a
mutual agreement in the revisions is reached. If the Contractor fails to
submit alternative revisions within one week of receipt of the CO's
proposed revisions, the Contractor will be deemed to have concurred with
the CO's proposed revisions.
1.12 OWNERSHIP OF FLOAT
Float available in the schedule, at any time, must not be considered for
the exclusive use of either the Government or the Contractor.
1.13 PAYMENT
Include an updated schedule with each progress payment request submitted.
The updated schedule will be used as a basis to evaluate the Contractor's
progress for purposes of payment. Lack of an updated schedule will result
in an inability of the CO to perform a full evaluation of the Contractor's
progress. Failure to provide all information, as specified, must result in
the disapproval of the entire Project Schedule submission. The CO may
withhold payment until the Contractor's schedule has been approved by the
SECTION 01 32 01.00 25 Page 14
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
Government. In the case where Project Schedule revisions have been
directed by the CO and those revisions have not been included in the
Project Schedule, the CO may hold retainage up to the maximum allowed by
Contract, each payment period, until revisions to the Project Schedule have
been made.
1.14 TRANSFER OF SCHEDULE DATA INTO RMS CM
Download and upload the schedule data into the Resident Management System
Contractor MODE (RMS CM), Section 01 45 00.15 25, RESIDENT MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM CONTRACTOR MODE (RMS CM), prior to databases being transferred to
the Government and is considered to be additional supporting data in a form
and detail required by the CO pursuant to FAR 52.232-5, PAYMENTS UNDER
FIXED-PRICE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS. The receipt of a proper payment
request pursuant to FAR 52.232-27, PROMPT PAYMENT FOR CONSTRUCTION
CONTRACTS, is contingent upon the Government receiving both acceptable and
approvable hard copies and electronic export from RMS CM of the application
for progress payment.

a. Prepare and maintain Submittal Register, ENG Form 4288-R, see
Section 01 45 00.15 25, RESIDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CONTRACTOR MODE (RMS
CM), as the work progresses. Do not change data which is output in
columns (c), (d), (e), and (f) as delivered by Government; retain data
which is output in columns (a), (g), (h), and (i) as approved. This
list may not be all inclusive and additional submittals may be
required. Do not preassign transmittal numbers when preparing the
submittal register. The preliminary and then the approved submittal
register will become the scheduling documents and will be updated
monthly and used to control submittals throughout the life of the
SECTION 01 33 00 Page 6
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
Contract.
b. The Government will provide the preliminary submittal register in
electronic format with the following fields completed, to the extent

Resubmittals must be associated with the "parent" by use of sequential
numbers (for example, resubmittal of transmittal 8 will be 8.1, 8.2,
etc). Government costs incurred after the first resubmittal may be
charged to the Contractor.
1.5.4 Information Only Submittals
1.5.4.1 General
Upload submittal with corresponding ENG 4025 forms as outlined in Paragraph
entitled E-SUBMITTALS. Normally information only submittals will not be
returned. Government approval is not required on information only
submittals. These submittals will be used for information purposes. The
Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to resubmit any
item found not to comply with the Contract. This does not relieve the
Contractor from the obligation to furnish material conforming to the plans
and specifications; will not prevent the CO from requiring removal and
replacement of nonconforming material incorporated in the work; and does
not relieve the Contractor of the requirement to furnish samples for
testing by the Government laboratory or for check testing by the Government
in those instances where the technical specifications so prescribe.
SECTION 01 33 00 Page 8
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
1.5.4.2 Processing of Information Only Submittals
Submit information only submittals electronically prior to delivery of the
material or equipment to the job site. ENG Form 4025-R must be marked with
the words "Contractor approved - information copy only" in the REMARKS
block of the form. Submittals will be monitored and spot checks made.
When such checks indicate noncompliance, the Contractor will be notified by
the same method used for Government Approval submittals. Resubmittal of
nonconforming information only submittals must be reclassified Government
Approval ("G") and re-submitted electronically for approval.
1.6 SUBMITTAL COORDINATION

1.6.3 Submittal Register Updates
The CQC System Manager must review the listing at least every 30 days and
take appropriate action to maintain an effective system. Submit copies of
updated or corrected listings to the CO at least every 30 days in the
quantity specified.
1.7 SCHEDULING
Schedule and submit concurrently submittals covering component items
forming a system or items that are interrelated. Adequate time (a minimum
of 30 calendar days) must be allowed and shown on the register for
Government review and approval. No delay damages or time extensions will
be allowed for time lost in late submittals.
a. Coordinate scheduling, sequencing, preparing, and processing of
submittals with performance of work so that work will not be delayed by
submittal processing. Allow for potential resubmittal of requirements.
b. Submittals called for by the Contract documents must be listed on
the register. Approval by the CO does not relieve the Contractor of
supplying submittals required by the Contract documents but which have
been omitted from the register.
c. Re-submit register and annotate monthly with actual submission and
approval dates. When all items on the register have been fully
approved, no further re-submittal is required.

SECTION 01 33 00 Page 9
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
submittal date shown on the approved "Submittal Register".
1.8 TRANSMITTAL FORM (ENG FORM 4025-R)
Use the sample transmittal form (ENG Form 4025-R, Attachment A2) for
submitting both Government Approval and Information Only submittals in
accordance with the instructions on the reverse side of the form. These
forms are included in the RMS CM software that the Contractor is required
to use for this Contract, per Section 01 45 00.15 25, RESIDENT MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM CONTRACTOR MODE (RMS CM). Fill forms in completely prior to
submittal. Exercise special care to ensure proper listing of the
specification paragraph number(s) and Contract Drawing sheet number(s)
pertinent to the data submitted for each item. List each submittal item
separately on the form, naming subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer;
applicable specification paragraph number(s); drawing/sheet number; pay
item number; and any other information needed to identify the item, define
its use, and locate it in the work. One or more ENG 4025-R forms may be
used per Specification Section, however, DO NOT include more than one
Specification Section per transmittal.
1.9 CROSS-REFERENCE (ENG FORM 4288-R/ENG FORM 4025-R)
To provide a cross-reference between the approved submittal register and
transmittal forms, record the "transmittal numbers" assigned when
submitting items in column "Transmittal No." of the ENG Form 4288-R. The
numbers in column "Transmittal No." of the submittal register must
correspond to the column "Item No." on ENG Form 4025-R.
1.10 SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES

dates of shipment or delivery to which the certificates apply. Copies of
laboratory test reports submitted with certificates must contain the name
and address of the testing laboratory and the date or dates of the tests to
which the report applies. Certification must not be construed as relieving
the Contractor from furnishing satisfactory material if, after tests are
performed on selected samples, the material is found not to meet the
specific requirements.
1.16 DISAPPROVED SUBMITTALS
a. Make all corrections required by the CO and promptly furnish a
corrected submittal in the form specified for the initial submittal.

and design of connection details and construction of work. Failure to
point out deviations may result in the Government requiring rejection
and removal of such work at the Contractor's expense.
b. If changes are necessary to submittals, make such revisions and
re-submit the submittals in accordance with the procedures above. No
item of work requiring a submittal change is to be accomplished until
the changed submittals are approved.
1.17 APPROVED SUBMITTALS
a. The CO's approval or acceptance of submittals must not be construed
as a complete check, and indicates only that the general method of
construction, materials, detailing, and other information are
satisfactory.

such approval and must not be construed to change or modify any
Contract requirements. Before submitting samples, ensure that the
materials or equipment will be available in quantities required. No
change or substitution will be permitted after a sample has been
approved.
b. If requested, approved and/or disapproved samples, including those
which may be damaged in testing, will be returned at the expense of the
Contractor upon completion of the Contract.
c. Failure of any materials to pass the specified tests will be
sufficient cause for refusal to consider, under this Contract, any
further samples of the same brand or make of that material. Government
reserves the right to disapprove any material or equipment which
previously has proved unsatisfactory in service.
d. Samples of various materials or equipment delivered on the site or
in place may be taken by the CO for testing. Samples failing to meet

to the start of each phase. Format subsequent AHAs as amendments to
the APP. Use the analysis during daily inspections to ensure the
implementation and effectiveness of the activity's safety and health
controls. Develop an AHA for every operation involving a type of work
presenting hazards not experienced in previous project operations or
where a new work crew or subcontractor is to perform work. The
analysis must identify and evaluate hazards and outline the proposed
methods and techniques for the safe completion of each phase of work.
At a minimum, define activity being performed, sequence of work,
specific safety and health hazards anticipated, control measures (to
include personal protective equipment) to eliminate or reduce each
hazard to acceptable levels, equipment to be used, inspection
requirements, training requirements for all involved, and the Competent
and Qualified Persons in charge of that phase of work. For work with
fall hazards, include fall hazards associated with scaffold erection
and removal, identify the appropriate fall arrest systems. For work

Contract.
3.8.2 Testing Laboratories
The Government reserves the right to check laboratory equipment in the
proposed laboratory for compliance with the standards set forth in the
Contract specifications and to check the laboratory technician's testing
procedures and techniques.
a. Validation. The validation of a testing laboratory is site-specific
and cannot be transferred to a facility at a different location. Costs
for validation by the Corps of Engineers MTC must be borne by the
laboratory or the Contractor. Validation is granted only for the
specific testing procedures requested to be validated. The laboratory
may select the testing procedures to be validated, except for the
Quality Assurance requirements of the applicable ASTM standards listed
in this Paragraph.
b. Validation Procedures. Validation of a testing laboratory consists
of either an inspection or audit, as defined below:
(1) Inspection must be performed by the MTC to verify compliance
with the applicable provisions of ASTM C1077, ASTM C1093,
ASTM D3666, ASTM D3740, and ASTM E329.
SECTION 01 45 00.00 25 Page 10
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
(2) An audit would be performed by the MTC in lieu of an
inspection for laboratories holding a current AASHTO
accreditation. Inspection by the MTC may be required after
auditing if critical testing procedures required in the Contract
were not included in the applicable CCRL or AMRL inspections.
c. Validation Schedule. For aggregate, concrete, bituminous materials,
soil, rock, riprap, and metal components, the frequency of validation
inspections or audits is once every two years. For water quality and
sediment testing the validation schedule is every 18 months. When
conditions change substantially from the time of the last validation,
laboratories must be re-validated.
d. Validation Process. For information on the validation process and
costs contact the MTC at (601) 634-2496. Procedures for validation,
including forms requesting validation may be obtained from the MTC web
site at: https://mtc.erdc.dren.mil/. The Contractor is cautioned that
the validation process is lengthy and that it requires immediate
action. Keep the CO informed about the validation process as it
proceeds in a timely manner.
3.8.3 Onsite Laboratory
The Government reserves the right to utilize the Contractor's control
testing laboratory and equipment to make assurance tests, and to check the
Contractor's testing procedures, techniques, and test results at no
additional cost to the Government.
3.8.4 Furnishing or Transportation of Samples for Testing
Costs incidental to the transportation of samples or materials must be
borne by the Contractor. Samples of materials for test verification and
acceptance testing by the Government must be delivered to the Portland
District Contract commercial Laboratory in the District area. Coordination
for each specific test, exact delivery location, and dates must be made
through the Portland District Resident Office.
3.9 COMPLETION INSPECTION
Completion inspections may be completed by feature or phase of work. For
example, inspection of the new low flow channel will be required before
flow is introduced to the low flow channel to allow the remainder of RCC
placement to occur.
3.9.1 Punch-Out Inspection
The CQC Manager must conduct an inspection of the work near the end of the
work, or any increment of the work established by a time stated in the
specifications, or the FAR 52.211-10, COMMENCEMENT, PROSECUTION, AND
COMPLETION OF WORK. As required by Paragraph DOCUMENTATION, prepare and
include in the CQC documentation a punch list of items which do not conform
to the approved drawings and specifications. Include within the list of
deficiencies the estimated date by which the deficiencies will be
corrected. The CQC System Manager or staff must make a second inspection
to ascertain that all deficiencies have been corrected. Once this is
accomplished, notify the Government that the facility is ready for the
Government Pre-Final inspection.
SECTION 01 45 00.00 25 Page 11
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
3.9.2 Pre-Final Inspection
The Government will perform the pre-final inspection to verify that the
work is complete. A Government Pre-Final Punch List may be developed as a
result of this inspection. The Contractor's CQC System Manager must ensure
that all items on this list have been corrected before notifying the
Government, so that a Final inspection with the customer can be scheduled.
Correct any items noted on the Pre-Final inspection in a timely manner.
These inspections and any deficiency corrections required by this Paragraph
must be accomplished within the time slated for completion of the entire
work or any particular increment of the work if the project is divided into
increments by separate completion dates.
3.9.3 Final Acceptance Inspection
The Contractor's Quality Control Inspection personnel, plus the
superintendent or other primary management person, and the CO must be in
attendance at the final acceptance inspection. Additional Government
personnel including, but not limited to, those from Base/Post Civil
Facility Engineer user groups and major commands may also be in
attendance. The final acceptance inspection will be formally scheduled by
the CO based upon results of the Pre-Final inspection. Notify the CO at
least 14 days prior to the final acceptance inspection and include the
Contractor's assurance that all specific items previously identified to the
Contractor as being unacceptable, along with all remaining work performed
under the Contract, will be complete and acceptable by the date scheduled
for the final acceptance inspection. Failure of the Contractor to have all
Contract work acceptably complete for this inspection will be cause for the
CO to bill the Contractor for the Government's additional inspection cost
in accordance with FAR 52.246-12, INSPECTION OF CONSTRUCTION.

1.2 CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION
The Government will use the Resident Management System (RMS) to assist in
its monitoring and administration of this contract. The Government
accesses the system using the Government Mode of RMS (RMS GM) and the
Contractor accesses the system using the Contractor Mode (RMS CM). The
term RMS will be used in the remainder of this section for both RMS GM and
RMS CM. The joint Government-Contractor use of RMS facilitates electronic
exchange of information and overall management of the contract. The
Contractor accesses RMS to record, maintain, input, track, and
electronically share information with the Government throughout the
contract period in the following areas:
Administration
Finances
Quality Control
Submittal Monitoring
Scheduling
Closeout
Import/Export of Data
The Contractor must be prepared to transition from the Resident Management
System (RMS) to the new Construction Management Platform (CMP) at any time
during the period of performance of this contract, once the USACE
enterprise implements this change. The Contractor's obligation to
transition from RMS to the CMP system is a requirement of this contract.
Therefore, additional time or cost increase to complete this transition
will not be considered. In the event of the transition, RMS project
information will be migrated to CMP by the government and available in the
CMP system. After the transition, the Contractor must utilize the CMP
system to perform all contract administration functions previously required
in RMS, including all areas listed above. After the transition, “RMS” and
“CMP” will be synonymous for all “Resident Management System” and “RMS”
references in this contract’s specification. To facilitate the transition
from RMS to CMP, online training for the CMP system will be made available
to the Contractor with enough time to train staff, prior to the transition
occurring.

1.3 DEFINITIONS
1.3.1 Contractor-Generated Hazardous Waste
Contractor-generated hazardous waste is material that, if abandoned or
disposed of, may meet the definition of a hazardous waste. These waste
streams typically consist of material brought on site by the Contractor to
execute work, but are not fully consumed during the course of
construction. Examples include, but are not limited to, excess paint
thinners (i.e. methyl ethyl ketone, toluene), waste thinners, excess
paints, excess solvents, waste solvents, excess pesticides, and
contaminated pesticide equipment rinse water. The cleanup of Contractor
spills of hazardous materials or petroleum products may also result in the
generation of Contractor-generated hazardous waste.
1.3.2 Electronics Waste
Electronics waste is discarded electronic devices intended for salvage,
recycling, or disposal.
1.3.3 Environmental Pollution and Damage
Environmental pollution and damage is the presence of chemical, physical,
or biological elements or agents that adversely affect human health or
welfare; unfavorably alter ecological balances of importance to human life;
affect other species of importance to humankind; or degrade the environment
aesthetically, culturally or historically.
SECTION 01 57 19.00 25 Page 5
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
1.3.4 Environmental Protection
Environmental protection is the prevention/control of pollution and habitat
disruption that may occur during construction. The control of
environmental pollution and damage requires consideration of land, water,
and air; biological and cultural resources; and includes management of
visual aesthetics; noise; solid, chemical, gaseous, and liquid waste;
radiant energy and radioactive material as well as other pollutants.
1.3.5 Hazardous Debris
Hazardous debris is debris that contains listed hazardous waste (either on
the debris surface, or in its interstices, such as pore structure) in
accordance with 40 CFR 261. Hazardous debris also includes debris that
exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste in accordance with 40 CFR 261.
1.3.6 Hazardous Materials
a. Hazardous materials as defined in 49 CFR 171 and listed in 49 CFR 172.
b. Hazardous material is any material that: Is regulated as a
hazardous material in accordance with 49 CFR 173; or requires a Safety
Data Sheet (SDS) in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120; or during end use,
treatment, handling, packaging, storage, transportation, or disposal
meets or has components that meet or have potential to meet the
definition of a hazardous waste as defined by 40 CFR 261 Subparts A, B,
C, or D. Designation of a material by this definition, when separately
regulated or controlled by other Sections or directives, does not
eliminate the need for adherence to that hazard-specific guidance which
takes precedence over this Section for "control" purposes. Such
material includes ammunition, weapons, explosive actuated devices,
propellants, pyrotechnics, chemical and biological warfare materials,
medical and pharmaceutical supplies, medical waste and infectious
materials, bulk fuels, radioactive materials, and other materials such
as asbestos, mercury, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).
1.3.7 Hazardous Waste
Hazardous Waste is any material that meets the definition of a solid waste
and exhibits a hazardous characteristic (ignitability, corrosivity,
reactivity, or toxicity) as specified in 40 CFR 261, Subpart C, is listed in
40 CFR 261, Subpart D, or is a mixture of a solid waste and one or more
hazardous wastes listed in 40 CFR 261, Subpart D.
1.3.8 Land Application
Land Application means spreading or spraying discharge water at a rate that
allows the water to percolate into the soil.
1.3.9 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
The NPDES permit program controls water pollution by regulating point
sources, including stormwater discharges from construction sites, that
discharge pollutants into waters of the United States. In the state of
Washington, the Department of Ecology has the delegated authority to
administer the NPDES program and issue permits.
SECTION 01 57 19.00 25 Page 6
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
1.3.10 Oily Waste
a. Oily wastes are materials that are, or were, mixed with Petroleum,
Oils, and Lubricants (POLs) and have become separated from the POLs.
Oily wastes also refers to materials, including wastewaters, centrifuge
solids, filter residues or sludges, bottom sediments, tank bottoms, and
sorbents which have come into contact with and have been contaminated
by POLs.
b. This definition includes materials such as oily rags, "kitty litter"
sorbent clay and organic sorbent material. These materials may be land
filled provided that: It is not prohibited in other state regulations
or local ordinances; the amount generated is "de minimis" (a small
amount); it is the result of minor leaks or spills resulting from
normal process operations; and free-flowing oil has been removed to the
practicable extent possible. Large quantities of this material,
generated as a result of a major spill or in lieu of proper maintenance
of the processing equipment, are a solid waste. As a solid waste,
perform a hazardous waste determination prior to disposal. As this can
be an expensive process, it is recommended that this type of waste be
minimized through good housekeeping practices and employee education.
1.3.11 Petroleum, Oils, and Lubricants (POLs)
POL products include flammable or combustible liquids, such as gasoline,
diesel, lubricating oil, used engine oil, hydraulic oil, mineral oil, and
cooking oil.
1.3.12 Regulated Waste
Regulated wastes are solid wastes that have specific additional Federal,
State, or local requirements for handling, storage, or disposal.
1.3.13 Sediment
Sediment is soil or other debris that has eroded and has been transported
by runoff water or wind.
1.3.14 Solid Waste
Solid waste is a solid, liquid, semi-solid or contained gaseous waste. A
solid waste can be a hazardous waste, non-hazardous waste, or non-Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulated waste. Types of solid waste
typically generated at construction sites may include:
1.3.14.1 Construction Debris
Construction debris is non-hazardous solid material generated during the
construction, demolition, or renovation of a structure that exceeds 2.5 inch
particle size that is: a manufactured object; plant or animal matter; or
natural geologic material (e.g., cobbles and boulders), broken or removed
concrete, masonry, rebar, and rock asphalt paving; ceramics; roofing paper
and shingles. A mixture of debris and other material is also subject to
regulation as debris if the mixture is comprised primarily of debris by
volume, based on visual inspection.
1.3.14.2 Non-Hazardous Waste
Non-hazardous waste is waste that is excluded from, or does not meet,

other waters must not be allowed to enter any water course without prior
treatment and without approval.
3.3.5 Invasive Species Prevention Measures for Boat Operations
Prevent contaminating the waters of the United States with invasive
species, particularly zebra mussels. Zebra mussels can be transported by
boats, trailers, outboard motors and other equipment such as tractors,
bulldozers, water pumps, ropes and nets that are used in areas that zebra
mussels inhabit. Zebra mussels have been found in several lakes and river
systems. If equipment is not properly inspected and treated to prevent the
spread of zebra mussels and other aquatic nuisance species, they can be
introduced into areas not currently infested. To assist in preventing the
introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species, the following
precautions must be taken:
a. Prior to transporting to site, visually inspect all equipment for
zebra mussels and other aquatic nuisance species. Remove all trash,
mud, vegetation, suspected zebra mussels, place in plastic bags, and
properly dispose of in land-based receptacles.
b. All construction equipment and supplies intended for use in water
that has been exposed to other lake or stream water must be thoroughly
washed with a power washed or be allowed to dry an appropriate length
of time in accordance with state guidance. Water being used for power
washing must be at least 160 degrees F when leaving the spray nozzle
and 140 degrees F when contacting the equipment being decontaminated.
All contaminated runoff must be adequately contained and disposed of
properly.

CONSTRUCTION SURVEYING
PART 1 GENERAL
1.1 GENERAL INFORMATION
a. The design drawings are based on topographic surveys and LIDAR data
described on the Survey Narrative, however the extent and coverage of
the data collected was limited by deep, moving water and sediments that
covered the bedrock surface. The Government generally considers the
pre-construction data to be insufficient for Quality Assurance and
Quality control during construction and additional data is necessary.
b. Existing Bedrock Survey No. 1: The bedrock and existing
Roller-Compacted Concrete (RCC) surface of the existing spillway (full
width) extending from the limits of the first raise to limits of the
second and beyond to the full extent of the spillway width extending in
the down stream direction (at least)to the dashed line on C-007 with a
label "NO DIVERSION AREA". This will require a survey at different
times depending on the Contractor's dewatering plan. Construction
activities executed under this Contract will have access to the bedrock
surface afforded by dewatering and foundation preparation.
c. RCC Footprint Survey No.2: The second survey will cover the entire
prepared surface for the RCC and plunge pool.
d. Top of RCC Survey No.3: The third survey will define the breaklines
and grades for the completed RCC and be used for As-Built drawing
submittals by Contractor specified in Section 01 78 39.10 25 AS-BUILT
DRAWINGS. It will also be used for quantity calculations and payment.
e. Topographic surveys and maps of the bedrock are required to verify
the elevations for Quality Assurance, Quality Control, and quantity
calculations. Contractor to submit electronic survey data for use by
the Government.
f. The Attachment A9, Cut and Fill Volume Report provides estimated
volume of cut and fill.

2.1 DESCRIPTION
This Section specifies the gathering of research documents, performance of
a topographic survey, and preparation of a topographic survey map.
2.2 DEFINITIONS
a. Professional Land Surveyor: One who possesses a valid state license
as a "Professional Land Surveyor" from the state in which they practice.
b. Professional Civil Engineer: One who possesses a valid state license
as a "Professional Civil Engineer" from the state in which they
practice. For this Section, the term "surveyor" must also include
Professional Civil Engineers authorized to practice Land Surveying
under the laws of the state in which they practice.
c. Break Lines: Breaklines are a series of points with x, y, z
coordinates that are connected to one another by linear segments.
These segments are represented by polylines, lines or shapes in AutoCAD.
Two or more points are required to define a breakline. Breaklines
represent discontinuities in the ground surface being surveyed such as
an abrupt change in slope, ridges, ditches, top edges of concrete
walls, and front and back of wall where earth and concrete meet.
Breaklines can also represent the limits of riprap, gravel surfacing,
cobble armor, edges of pavement, and edges of concrete, etc. When
triangulating a surface that contains breakline data, triangles are
formed so that no triangle side crosses a breakline segment. The
breakline holds a linear relationship that might otherwise be removed
during triangulation. Breaklines should not cross one another unless
they have a crossing point with the same x, y and z (coordinate).
d. Random Points: Represent randomly occurring points with x,y,z
coordinates. Random points are collected because they are points that
generally define the surface and can be uniformly or non-uniformly
spaced. Random points are referred to as regular points, spots
elevation or ground shots. Random points are also surveyed at high and
low spots in the topography.
e. Sufficient Density: Data collection for breaklines or random points
SECTION 01 71 23.16 25 Page 3
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
of survey that capture all necessary surface topography. Random and
breakline points must be surveyed at intervals to meet the map accuracy

MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
3.2.2 Survey of Existing Bedrock
a. Collect topographic data for bedrock surface after all foundation
preparation has been completed. The scope of bedrock cleaning is
limited to the RCC placement area, however, the bedrock survey should
include all bedrock within the existing spillway channel from the
downstream limits of the first spillway raise to the limits of this
second RCC raise and beyond to the limits of the cleared vegetation
area on C-005. Existing RCC must be prepared and cleaned prior to the
bedrock survey to ensure extents are captured.
b. The data must be of sufficient density and accuracy to compute
volumes of roller-compacted concrete (RCC) placed for the spillway
raise.
c. It is anticipated that there will be enough exposed bedrock in the
channel outside the RCC placement area that a reasonable topographic
surface can be created and still meet the mapping standards specified.
If substantial sediment deposits exist on the bedrock, they must be
illustrated on the prepared map.
d. Collect an Orthophoto of the prepared bedrock surface for each
de-watered area of the RCC footprint, understanding that this will
require two photos covering the entire spillway limits of construction
shown on the plans and at least 100 feet beyond. The Contract drawings
show an orthophoto of the spillway channel during the first spillway
raise that does not meet this specification because the surface was not
fully prepared at the time of the photo collection.
3.3 RCC FOOTPRINT SURVEY
A survey and map of the final prepared surface for the RCC including the
plunge pool excavation is required to verify the elevations for Quality
Assurance, Quality Control, and quantity calculations. Contractor to

Give first consideration to reusing construction and demolition materials
as a disposition strategy. Recover for reuse materials, products, and
components as described in the approved Construction Waste Management
Plan. Coordinate with the CO to identify onsite reuse opportunities or
material sales or donation available through Government resale or donation
programs. Sale of recovered materials is not allowed on Government
property or at the Construction site, unless approved by the CO. Consider
the use of surplus industrial supply broker services, who match entities
with reusable or repurpose industrial materials with entities with need of
such materials.
1.11.2 Recycle
Recycle non-hazardous construction and demolition/debris materials that are
not suitable for reuse. Track rejection of contaminated recyclable
materials by the recycling facility. Rejected recyclables materials will
not be counted as a percentage of diversion calculation. Recycle all
fluorescent lamps, HID lamps, mercury (Hg) -containing thermostats and
ampoules, and PCBs-containing ballasts and electrical components as
directed by the CO. Do not crush lamps on site as this creates a hazardous
waste stream with additional handling requirements.
1.11.3 Compost
Consider composting off site if a reasonable amount of compostable
materials will be available and a utilization of compostable material can
be determined and appropriately planned for. Compostable materials include
plant materials, sawdust and certain food scraps. Composting as a strategy
must be explicitly addressed in the Construction Waste Management Plan
submitted for approval to ensure it is feasible.
1.11.4 Waste
Dispose by landfill or incineration only those waste materials with no
practical use, economic benefit, or recycling opportunity.

to the downstream side. The upstream end of the through-pipes are
underwater and saturated loose sediment. The slide gates on the top five
pipes are closed. The pipes extend through a valve pit about 6 feet wide
in the downstream direction. There is a knife valve on 25 of the 30
through-pipes on the upstream side of the valve pit. Some of the valves
are continually leaking and present a problem for placing and curing
concrete around them for decommissioning purposes. The water leaks must be
mitigated for under this Contract as described below. The remaining five
pipes on the upper level are only run with the sluice gates on the upstream
end. The through pipes are made of steel or concrete depending on location
however, portions within the valve pit are all steel. Steel segments exist
5 feet upstream of the knife valve and 15-feet downstream. The valve pit
is drained by six pipes (8 inch diameter) extending through 10 feet of
concrete on the downstream side. The valve pit is considered confined
space per EM 385-1-1. Government assumes the steel pipes with open sluice
gates and closed knife gates are partially filled with sediment because
some of the leaking valves have passed sediment into the valve pit. The
ventilation and lighting systems were operable during the last inspection
in March 2021, but those systems cannot be relied upon for this Contract.
The valves for the steel pipes operate on a pneumatic system. The
pneumatic air system does not work. There is no need to operate the valves
for decommissioning purposes. There is 6 to 18 inches of sediment in the
base of the valve pit. Detailed record drawings of the valve pit and all
features inside are provided in FIFO drawings.
1.2.4 General Requirements
Do not begin demolition or deconstruction until authorization is received
from the CO. Remove rubbish and debris from the project site; do not allow
accumulations inside or outside the outlet works except for approved
staging areas. In the interest of occupational safety and health, perform
the work in accordance with EM 385-1-1, Section 23, Demolition, and other
applicable Sections. Required activities for decommissioning include but
are not limited to the list below:
SECTION 02 41 00.00 25 Page 3
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
a. The outlet works contains 30 steel pipes that are 36-inches
diameter. 25 of those pipes have knife valve closures and 5 are open
pipes. The last Government inspection in 2021 identified 6 leaking
valves that will require hot tapping or an alternate plug method as
noted in Part 1.2.4(c). Without a recent inspection the current
conditions in the valve pit are unknown. The 25 pipes fitted with
valves forms the baseline valve hot tapping quantity for this
Contract. Document the pipes and valves with leaking conditions as
defined in Part 1.2.1.5 Leaks and submit a Valve Inspection Report to
the CO for approval.
b. Hot tap the leaking knife valves and pressurize with CONTROLLED LOW
STRENGTH MATERIAL (CLSM) per Section 03 52 01.00 25 or other type of
sealant to be reviewed and approved by the CO. The box should be
capable of draining the leaking water and have a port for pumping the
CLSM. The valve stem may be removed. The box or pump system must have
a pressure measuring device for quality control. The box must be
capable of containing a minimum pressures of 30 pounds per square inch.
The box must conform to at least two surfaces,
(1) the vertical face of the concrete upstream of the valve and
(2) the circumference of the steel pipe downstream of the valve.
The hot tap is intended to be permanent.
c. If the valve is leaking into the pipe, extend the hot tap in such a
way as to plug the pipe at the same time. Submit a shop drawing of the
planned fabrication along with the Decommissioning Plan. (Contractor
may submit to the CO for approval an alternate plan to plug the steel
pipe upstream of the knife valve if effective in stopping leaks.)
d. Clean and plug all steel through pipes (30) with CONTROLLED LOW
STRENGTH MATERIAL (CLSM) per Section 03 52 01.00 25 or other type of
sealant to be reviewed and approved by the CO. The inside of the pipes
must be cleaned of all sediment and debris. The plug extends from the
knife valve to the downstream end of the steel pipe. Place temporary
covers on the downstream end of the steel through pipes. Specify how
the temporary covers will be fixed in the decommissioning plan. No
permanent covers are allowed since the historic appearance must be
maintained.
e. There are six pipes (illustrated on the record drawings) that drain
the valve pit, all 8 inch diameter. Maintain drainage operation until
the valve pit is filled with concrete. Block the entrance of the
drainage pipes at the appropriate time to prevent from being filled
with concrete.
f. Remove all steel bolted to the interior of the valve pit including
grating and structural supports, ventilation pipes, all electrical
conductors and conduits, all pneumatic lines, and other miscellaneous
items identified during the initial survey. Also remove any
ventilation, electrical panels and hatch covers on the roof deck.
g. Clean mud from bottom of valve pit.
h. Place a layer of filter gravel on the bottom of the valve pit. The
gravel must be open graded crushed or uncrushed rock meeting SOT
specification 9-03.12(4) Gravel Backfill for Drains. Build a screen
SECTION 02 41 00.00 25 Page 4
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
for the lowest drain pipe at elevation 880 feet. The screen should
extend at least 2 inches above the crown of the pipe and extend down to
the pit floor and fastened to the vertical concrete face to prevent
movement during filter and CLSM placement. The screen must be HYDE and
have holes 3/8 inch diameter drilled at center spacing of 3/4 inch.
The screen should be capable of resisting forces due to the filter rock
layer and overlying liquid CLSM. The gravel must be a minimum of 8
inches deep across the pit floor and extend above the crown of the
lowest drainage pipe at elevation 880 feet. Cover the filter gravel
with a non-woven geotextiles and secure it so as to maintain horizontal
coverage while placing CLSM above it. Include details of the screen
and filter product source and method of securing textile placenta in
the decommissioning plan.
i. Fill the valve pit from bottom to Elevation 939 feet at the roof
deck with CONTROLLED LOW STRENGTH MATERIAL (CLSM) per Section
03 52 01.00 25, CONTROLLED LOW STRENGTH MATERIAL (CLSM). CLSM must be
flush with existing concrete surface.

MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
1.6.3 Proportioning Responsibility
Adjustments will be made to the batch weights, including cement, pozzolan,
and water, to maintain the necessary consistency to prevent segregation
within the RCC and allow full compaction as determined. Frequent changes
to the batch weights must be considered usual and can be expected to occur
frequently during the course of each day's placement depending on such
variables as humidity, wind velocity, temperature, and cloud cover. Such
changes will be as directed. The Contractor must be responsible for
adjusting the added water to compensate for changes in aggregate moisture
content only.

1.6.5 Consistency of RCC
The Contracting Officer (CO) will determine at the placement site on a
continuing basis the proper consistency necessary for adequate hauling,
spreading, and compacting and will direct all necessary changes to achieve
the proper RCC consistency. Changes will be directed based on visual
examination of the RCC during the spreading and compaction process and on
the Vebe time when it varies outside the range considered ideal for
compaction, as determined by the Government using the modified Vebe
apparatus, in accordance with COE CRD-C 53.
1.6.6 Construction Tolerances
The definitions of the terms used in the following Section must be as
defined in ACI 117. Make level and grade tolerance measurements as soon as
possible after finishing. When forms or shoring are used, the measurements
must be made prior to removal. Tolerances are not cumulative. The most
restrictive tolerance controls. Tolerances must not extend the structures
beyond legal boundaries. Except as specified otherwise, plus tolerance
increases the amount or dimension to which it applies or raises a level
alignment, and minus tolerance decreases the amount or dimension to which
it applied or lowers a level alignment. A tolerance without sign means
plus or minus. Where only one signed tolerance is specified, there is no
limit in the other direction.

1.8 DELIVERY, STORAGE, AND HANDLING
1.8.1 Cementitious Materials
1.8.1.1 Transportation
When bulk cement or pozzolan is not unloaded from primary carriers directly
into weather-tight hoppers at the batching plant, transportation from the
railhead, mill, or intermediate storage to the batching plant must be
accomplished in adequately designed weather-tight trucks, conveyors, or
other means that will protect the material from exposure to moisture.
1.8.1.2 Storage
Furnish cementitious materials in bulk. Immediately upon receipt at the
site of the work, all cementitious materials must be stored in a dry,
SECTION 03 37 23.00 25 Page 12
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
weather-tight, and properly ventilated structure. All storage facilities
must permit easy access for inspection and identification. Sufficient
materials must be in storage for at least two operating days of continuous
placement. In order that cement may not become unduly aged after delivery,
use any cement that has been stored at the site for 60 days or more before
using cement of lesser age.
1.8.2 Aggregate Storage
Fine aggregate and each size of coarse aggregate must be stored in separate
size groups adjacent to the batch plant and in such a manner as to prevent
the intermingling of size groups or the inclusion of foreign materials in
the aggregate. Sufficient fine and coarse aggregate must be maintained at
the site for at least seven operating days of continuous placement.
1.8.3 Chemical Admixtures
Any admixture that has been in storage at the project site for longer than
recommended by the manufacturer or that has been subjected to freezing must
not be used in the work and must be removed from the site.
1.9 ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS
If unusual adverse weather, such as heavy rain, severe cold, high winds,
heavy snow, etc., occurs or is forecast to occur during placement, the
placement operation must be suspended until conditions improve.
1.9.1 Placing During Rain
RCC must not be placed during rainfall of 0.1 inch/hr or more. During
periods of lesser rainfall, placement of RCC may continue if, in the
opinion of the CO, no damage to the RCC is occurring. Work must commence
only after excess free surface water and contaminated paste or RCC have
been removed and the surface has gained sufficient strength (no less than
four hours after the RCC placement was suspended) to prevent rutting,
pumping, intermixing of rainwater with the RCC, or other damage to the
RCC. When the RCC surface has been contaminated or damaged in any manner,
the RCC surface must be washed to break up and remove laitance or mud-like
coatings from the surface. Any undercut coarse aggregate must be removed.
All waste must be removed and disposed of in an approved manner.
1.9.2 Hot-Weather Placement
In hot-weather placement the temperature of the RCC must be controlled so
that it does not exceed 75.0 degrees F when placed. Placement must be
suspended as soon as the RCC temperature exceeds 75 degrees F. Measures
that can be taken to prevent temperatures exceeding 75 degrees F include,
but are not limited to, chilling mixing water, sprinkling aggregate
stockpiles, use of a canopy to shade the RCC placement areas, placing
during nighttime and early morning hours, or restricting placements to
cloudy days. Use of any of these systems must not be reason for extension
of completion dates specified in these specifications.

The continuous mixer(s) must have proper introduction of ingredients as
specified by the manufacturer and must not be charged in excess of the
manufacturer's recommended capacity. Mixer(s) must be capable of combining
the materials into a uniform homogeneous mixture and of discharging this
mixture without segregation. The mixer(s) must operate at the blade speed
designated by the manufacturer and must be capable of changing retention
time of the ingredients in the mixer. This should be accomplished by
manually resetting the mixer(s) blade angles. Mixing time (ingredient
SECTION 03 37 23.00 25 Page 22
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
retention time in the mixer) must be predicated upon the uniformity,
homogeneity, and consistency of the resultant mixture. Samples for
uniformity testing must be taken at two minute intervals and tested in
accordance with COE CRD-C 55 and paragraph MIXER UNIFORMITY REQUIREMENTS
below. The mixer(s) must be maintained in satisfactory operating condition
and mixer blades must be kept free of hardened concrete. Should mixer(s)
at any time produce unsatisfactory results, its use must be promptly
discontinued until it is repaired. Suitable facilities must be provided
for obtaining representative samples of concrete for testing. All
necessary platforms, shelters, tools, labor, and equipment must be provided
for obtaining samples.
2.2.6.5 Segregation
A means must be used to reduce and minimize segregation and waste which
would otherwise result from the continuous stream of concrete being fed
into the batch haul devices (concrete buckets, dump trucks, etc.). The
equipment must retain the concrete between tracks or other means of
transport to prevent the need for stopping the mixer. These devices could
include, but not be limited to, small-volume conveyor discharge hopper with
a large gate that is automatically opened on a timed interval, thereby
dumping a series of small batches into larger batch hoppers, trucks, or
truck beds.
2.2.6.6 Trial Operation
Not less than seven days prior to commencement of concrete placing, a test
of the plant must be made in the presence of a representative of the CO to
check operational adequacy. The number of cubic yards required to be
produced in trial runs must be as directed, but will not exceed 200 cubic
yards. All concrete produced in these tests must be wasted or used for
purposes other than inclusion in structures covered by this specification.
All deficiencies found in plant operation must be corrected to the
satisfaction of the CO prior to the start of concrete placing operations.
Mixer uniformity tests by the Government will be performed near the end of
this trial period. No separate payment will be made to the Contractor for
labor or materials required by provisions of this paragraph. Notify the CO
of the trial operation not less than seven days prior to the start of the
trial operation.
2.2.6.7 Protection
The weighing, indicating, recording, and control equipment must be
protected against exposure to dust, moisture, and vibration so that there
is no interference with proper operation of the equipment.
2.2.7 Laboratory Areas
A room must be provided adjacent to the plant to house the moisture and
grading testing equipment for aggregate and to provide working space for
the Government representative. Another room must be provided for testing
fresh concrete and for fabricating and initial curing (approximately 72
hours) of concrete test specimens in accordance with ASTM C31/C31M. The
size, arrangement, and location of these rooms will be subject to approval
by the CO. Provide electricity, air-conditioning, heat, and water as
required for use in these laboratory areas.

2.2.8 Mixers
Mixers must be stationary mixers or pugmill mixers. Truck mixers may be
used for bedding mortar. Mixers may be batch or continuous mixing. Each
mixer must combine the materials into a uniform mixture and discharge this
mixture without segregation. Mixers must not be charged in excess of the
capacity recommended by the manufacturer on the nameplate. Excessive
overmixing requiring additions of water will not be permitted. The mixers
must be maintained in satisfactory operating condition, and mixer drums
must be kept free of hardened concrete. Mixer blades or paddles must be
replaced when worn down more than 10 percent of their depth when compared
with the manufacturer's dimension for new blades. Should any mixer at any
time produce unsatisfactory results, its use must be promptly discontinued
until it is repaired or replaced.
2.2.9 Truck Mixers
Truck mixers may be used for mixing of bedding morter, only. Those mixers
must conform to the requirements of ASTM C94/C94M. Each truck must be
equipped with two counters from which it must be possible to determine the
number of revolutions at mixing speed and the number of revolutions at
agitating speed. The acceptability of truck mixers for uniform mixing must
be determined by uniformity tests in accordance with ASTM C94/C94M.
2.2.10 Pugmill Mixers
A batch or continuous mixing twin-shaft pugmill mixer must be capable of
producing RCC of the same quality and uniformity as would be produced in a
conventional plant that meets all the requirements of these specification.
All pugmill mixers must meet the requirements of paragraph CONTINUOUS
MIXING PLANT(S) above.
2.2.11 Mixer Uniformity Requirements
a. All mixers, except for truck mixers, will be tested by the
Government in accordance with this paragraph and in accordance with
COE CRD-C 55. When regular testing is performed, the conventional
concrete must meet the limits of any five of the six applicable
uniformity requirements, and the RCC must meet the limits of any three
of the four applicable uniformity requirements. When abbreviated
testing is performed, the concrete must meet only those requirements
listed for abbreviated testing. The initial mixer evaluation test must
be a regular test and must be performed prior to the start of concrete
placement. The concrete proportions used for the evaluation must
contain the largest size aggregate on the project and must be as
directed by the CO. Regular testing must consist of performing all
tests on three batches of concrete. The range for regular testing must
be the average of the ranges of the three batches. Abbreviated testing
must consist of performing the required tests on a single batch of
concrete. The range for abbreviated testing must be the range for one
batch. If more than one mixer is used and all are identical in terms
of make, type, capacity, condition, speed of rotation, etc., the
results of tests on one of the mixers must apply to the others, subject
to the approval of the CO. Mixer evaluations must be performed by the
Government. Provide labor and equipment as directed by the CO to
assist the Government in performing the tests.

and when the Contractor requests a reduced mixing time. An abbreviated
test must be performed every three months when concrete is being
placed. If a mixer fails the abbreviated test, a regular test will be
performed. Cost of testing when the Contractor requests a reduced
mixing time will be paid by the Contractor.
2.2.12 Sampling Facilities
2.2.12.1 Sampling Concrete

MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
means of main-line conveyor, end-dump truck, front-end loader, or a
combination thereof.
c. indicating and signaling devices must be provided for the control
and identification of types or classes of concrete as they are mixed
and discharged for transfer to the placement site.
d. Each type or class of concrete must be visually identified by
placing a colored tag or other marker as it leaves the mixing plant so
that the concrete may be positively identified and placed in the
structure in the desired position.
2.2.13.1 Trucks
Truck mixers or agitators used for transporting bedding morter must conform
to the applicable requirements of ASTM C94/C94M. Bodies of nonagitating
trucks must be smooth, water-tight, metal containers specifically designed
to transport concrete, shaped with rounded corners to minimize segregation.
2.2.13.2 Belt Conveyors
Belt conveyors must be designed and operated to assure a uniform flow of
concrete from mixer or delivery truck to final place of deposit without
segregation of ingredients or loss of mortar and must be provided with
positive means for preventing segregation of the concrete or loss of mortar
at transfer points and the point of placing. The NMSA required in mixture
proportions furnished by the Government will not be changed to accommodate
the belt width.
2.2.14 Spreading and Remixing Equipment
The spreading and remixing equipment must conform to the following
requirements:
a. The primary spreading procedure must be accomplished by dozer.
Graders or other equipment not specified may be used to facilitate the
RCC spreading process only when approved.
b. For open, unrestricted areas, the dozer must be a minimum size and
weight equivalent to a Caterpillar D-6. For restricted placement
areas, such as placement of RCC near the dam crest or next to
abutments, the dozer must have as a minimum a size and weight
equivalent to a Caterpillar D-4.
c. A minimum of one operating dozer for each 200 cubic yards of RCC
placed each hour. The dozers must be equipped with well maintained
grousers. A front-end loader with operator must be available to assist
with deposition and spreading of RCC as needed in confined areas.
d. The equipment must be maintained in good operating condition. The
equipment must not leak or drip oil, grease, or other visible
contaminants onto the RCC surface.
e. All equipment used for spreading and remixing that leaves the
surface of the structure for maintenance or repairs or, for any other
reason, must be cleaned of all contaminants by an approved method
before returning to the structure surface. Under no conditions must a
dozer or other tracked vehicle be operated on other than fresh
uncompacted RCC except to facilitate startup operations for each lift
SECTION 03 37 23.00 25 Page 26
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
and by approved procedures.
2.2.15 Compaction Equipment
Submit a listing of the equipment proposed for transporting, handling,
depositing, spreading, and compacting the concrete for review by the CO not
later than 30 days after Notice to Proceed. Include site drawings or
sketches with locations of equipment and placement site. The compaction
equipment must conform to the following requirements.
2.2.15.1 Primary Rollers
Self-propelled vibratory rollers must be used for primary rolling and must
be double-drum. They must transmit a dynamic impact to the surface through
a smooth steel drum by means of revolving weights, eccentric shafts, or
other equivalent methods. The compactor must have a minimum gross mass of
20,000 pounds and must produce a minimum dynamic force of 350 pounds/linear
inch of drum width. The operating frequency must be variable in the
approximate range of 1,700 to 3,000 cycles per minute. The amplitude must
be adjustable between 0.015 and 0.04 inches. The roller must be capable of
full compaction in both forward and reverse directions. The roller must be
operated at speeds not exceeding 2.2 ft/s. Within the range of the
operating capability of the equipment, the CO may direct or approve
variations to the frequency, amplitude, and speed of operation which result
in the specified density at the fastest production rate.
2.2.15.2 Small Vibratory Rollers
Small vibratory rollers must be used to compact the RCC where the larger
vibratory rollers specified above cannot maneuver. The rollers must
compact the RCC to the required density and must be so demonstrated during
construction of the test section. Small vibratory rollers cannot compact
the RCC to the same density and thickness as the primary rollers;
therefore, when small rollers are used, total lift thickness of the RCC
layer or lift must be reduced to not over 6 inches uncompacted thickness to
permit adequate compaction. Rollers must have independent speed and
vibration controls and must be capable of a wide range of speed adjustments.
2.2.15.3 Tampers (Rammers)
The tampers must compact the RCC to the required density and must be so
demonstrated during construction of the test section. Tampers cannot
compact the RCC to the same density and thickness as the primary rollers;
therefore, when tampers are used, thickness of each RCC layer that is to be
compacted must be reduced to not more than 6 inches uncompacted thickness
to assure adequate compaction.
2.2.16 Truck-Mounted Vacuum Pickup System
A truck-mounted vacuum pickup system must be provided for various cleanup
operations from the beginning of foundation cleanup to final placement of
job RCC. The unit(s) must be capable of pumping 4,500 cubic feet of air
per minute through an 8 inch diameter opening and capable of pumping water
at a minimum rate of 2,000 gpm. The equipment must be maintained in good
operating condition. The equipment must not leak cleanup water and other
debris during equipment operation or transit. The equipment must not leak
or drip oil, grease, or other visible contamination onto the RCC.
SECTION 03 37 23.00 25 Page 27
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
2.2.17 Other Motorized Equipment
All other equipment (backhoe with vibratory plate, backhoe with immersion
vibrators, backhoe with mandrel for inserting contraction joint plates,
wash trucks, etc.) necessary for the successful completion of RCC
production, but not previously discussed within these specifications (or
determined to be necessary during the course of the work), must be approved
prior to actual use. Such equipment must not result in any damage to the
RCC, must be maintained in good operating condition, and must be operated
by skilled Contractor-provided personnel.
2.2.18 Nuclear Density Gauge
Tests to determine the density of both the uncompacted and compacted RCC
must be made by the Contractor using a two-probe nuclear density gauge
supplied by the Contractor. The nuclear density gauge must meet the
applicable requirements of ASTM C1040/C1040M. The gauge must be capable of
taking readings along a horizontal path between the probes at 2 inch
increments from 2 inches from the surface to 24 inches below the surface.
The gauge and operator must be made available to the Government until
completion of all RCC production at no additional cost. Obtain all permits
and certifications for the equipment and the operators.
2.2.19 Calibration
Nuclear gauges must have been factory calibrated within six months of RCC
placement. Construct, at no additional costs to the Government, three
conventional concrete test blocks using RCC coarse aggregates and RCC fine
aggregate, and with dimensions 12 inches larger than the gauge dimensions.
The concrete must be formulated to have densities of approximately 130,
145, and 160 lb/cu ft using the RCC materials and so far as possible,
similar relative proportions. Completed blocks must be weighed and
measured to determine unit weight. Gauge calibration constants must be
adjusted for performance on these blocks at least seven days prior to the
evaluation of test strips. Remedy any inconsistencies in gauge performance
prior to the start of RCC placement. After the start of RCC placement,
gauges must be field recalibrated against cast blocks every 24 hours.
PART 3 EXECUTION
3.1 PREPARATION FOR PLACING
3.1.1 Placing Schedule
At least seven days before starting RCC production, a detailed schedule
must be submitted indicating intended daily and weekly production rates
that, when followed, will meet the beginning and ending specified RCC
production dates. This RCC lift plan is to include the plan and sequence of
work, including graphical depictions of lifts based off of the foundation
survey. After initiation of RCC production, the Contractor's schedule must
be updated and adjusted on a weekly basis for the duration of the RCC
placement. If it becomes apparent for any reason that the Contractor is
not pursuing a schedule that will meet the specified RCC production dates,
actions necessary to increase the production rate must be taken so that
production is once again on schedule, within five calendar days after
written notice. Also, if not back on schedule by the end of the seven day
period, the Government reserves the right at this time to direct the
Contractor, at no additional cost to the Government, to increase the amount
and size of crews and equipment.
SECTION 03 37 23.00 25 Page 28
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
3.1.2 RCC Orientation Session
Prior to or in conjunction with the construction of the RCC test section,
supervisors and all other Contractor personnel which are expected to
participate in the production of RCC for this job (including laborers,
equipment operators, foremen, and QC and inspection staff) must participate
in a two-hour orientation session organized by the Contractor and led by
their RCC specialist. Provide a facility suitable for slide and videotape
presentation. The intent is to orient all individuals on the goals of the
RCC placement process, provide clarification of specification requirements
if requested, and be provided orientation as to what constitutes good
construction practices. Additional orientation sessions will also be made
available to, and must be attended by, all new Contractor personnel who are
subsequently hired and that will be involved with the production of the RCC.
3.1.3 Aggregate Production Schedule
Aggregate production and initial stockpiling must begin and must be
producing acceptable material by not later than seven days in advance of
the time when placement of the RCC test section is expected to begin.
Submit descriptions and details for all methods and operations proposed for
aggregate and concrete operations including daily and weekly production
rates, not later than 15 days after Notice to Proceed for review and
approval for conformance with specifications.
3.1.4 RCC Test Section
Prior to placement of any RCC, construct a test section. The purpose of
the test section is to demonstrate the suitability of the Contractor's
equipment, methods, and personnel. The test section must be at least three
lifts in height and be at least 100 feet long and 20 feet wide at the top.
The site of the test section must be approved. Trial batches can be done
in conjunction with the test section. After evaluation and assessment of
the test section by the CO, dispose of the test section in an approved
manner. Under no circumstances must the test section be incorporated into
or become a part of the permanent RCC structure. The test section must
demonstrate sustained plant production rates, and batching, mixing,
transporting, spreading, and compaction procedures. It must also
demonstrate the vertical face construction method along one side, the
sloped face construction method along another side, procedures for
foundation and concrete surface preparation and cleanup, procedures for
placement of concrete, bedding mortar, and other conventional concrete.
Do not begin RCC operations for the main structure until testing and
evaluations by the Government have been completed, and it has been
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the CO that all specification
requirements were met. Following completion of test section construction,
10 days must be allowed for testing and evaluations. If the Contractor
does not meet requirements as specified, an additional test section or
sections must be constructed at no additional cost to the Government. The
date of the test section construction must be provided at least seven days
in advance.
3.1.5 Surface Preparation
3.1.5.1 Cleaning
All lift surfaces including any RCC, dental concrete, concrete, bedding
mortar, or other conventional concrete placed adjacent to and at the same
SECTION 03 37 23.00 25 Page 29
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
time as the RCC must be cleaned prior to placing any additional concrete
thereon. After cleaning, concrete and bedding mortar are to be used
specifically for achieving bond between different types of concrete and
foundation and eliminating and preventing segregation or voids along
margins or RCC placements. No surfaces to receive concrete or bedding
mortar must be covered with RCC until the prepared surfaces have been
accepted in writing and that acceptance has been recorded on an approved
checkout form. All surfaces upon which RCC or any bedding mortar placed
must be moist (but contain no visible free water). Prior to placing any
concrete adjacent to and at the same time as the RCC, all surfaces must be
clean and free of loose, unkeyed, or deteriorated rock; all mud and silt
accumulations; vegetation; laitance; puddles or ponds of free surface
water; coatings; and any other detrimental materials. High-pressure water
jetting, or wet sandblasting, followed by mild high-volume, low-pressure
washing, must be used on all hardened concrete surfaces (cold joints) as
necessary for the removal of laitance, coatings, stains, or other
difficult-to-remove contaminants. High-volume low-pressure water washing
or water jetting may be used for removal of loose materials. Adequate
equipment with operators must be on hand at the site to clean all surfaces
in conformance with these specifications without disrupting in any way the
RCC production as scheduled.
3.1.5.2 High-Volume Low-Pressure Washing
Washing of loose materials can be accomplished with high-volume
low-pressure water washing or air water jetting using equipment of similar
design to that used in large-scale foundation cleanups. The air-water jets
must have 1 1/2 inch nozzles, a water supply of at least 30 gpm, and
compressed air at the jet of 80 to 120 psi. The low-pressure water jets
must have one inch nozzles available and a capacity of at least 200 gpm for
truck-mounted devices.
3.1.5.3 High-Pressure Water Jet
A stream of water under a pressure of not less than 1,500 psi for RCC and
4,000 psi for conventional concrete must be used for cleaning all cold
joint surfaces, or surfaces with laitance, mortar coatings, stains, or
other difficult-to-remove contaminants. There must be no undercutting of
coarse-size aggregates. Aggregate particles that are undercut must be
removed. For cleaning large open areas larger than 5,000 square feet, the
high-pressure water jet system must be truck-mounted. For cleaning small
or confined areas, the high-pressure water jet system must be portable.
3.1.5.4 Waste Disposal
Any waste water employed in cutting, washing, and rinsing of concrete
surfaces, and any other surface water must not stain, or affect exposed
surfaces of the structure(s) or damage the environment of the project
area. The method of disposal must be subject to approval.
3.2 PLACING
3.2.1 Procedures
It is the intent of this Contract to raise the structure at essentially the
same level across the entire horizontal surface area. As the advancing
edge of the lift progresses, the exposed leading edges must be kept "live"
by progressively placing out from the advancing edge in a sloping and
uniform fan-like manner. RCC must be deposited (from the conveyor,
SECTION 03 37 23.00 25 Page 30
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
end-dump truck, or front-end loader) on the uncompacted RCC of the
advancing edge in a forward direction from the dump pile. RCC must not be
placed in consecutive or consistent lanes. The dump location must be
varied to avoid "lane" construction. The interval between batch plant
mixing and final RCC compaction must be no greater than 45 minutes. Final
compaction is defined as: Any RCC lift composed of layers that have been
worked twice by dozer grousers, receives four passes with the vibratory
roller, and meets the density requirements.
3.2.2 Bedding Mortar
The bedding mortar must be applied to the existing surface following any
required cleanup. The bedding mortar must be applied not more than 15
minutes ahead of RCC placement, unless otherwise approved. The bedding
mortar must be used between hardened conventional concrete and RCC, between
different RCC placements where cold joints occur, and other locations as
directed or as shown in the drawings. The bedding mortar must have an
average thickness after application of between 1/4 and 1/2 inch and must
cover 100 percent of the lift area.
3.2.3 Lift Thickness
The total lift thickness after final compaction by the vibratory roller
must be 12 inches.
3.2.4 Depositing, Spreading, and Remixing
After the RCC has been deposited, the RCC must be spread by dozers into
gently sloping layers, approximately 6 inches thick, that will, after final
compaction of the several layers by the vibratory roller, result in the
specified lift thickness. During the spreading process, the dozer
operators must continuously work the RCC surfaces with the dozer blade and
grousers in a manner to remix any RCC that may contain pockets of
segregated material and to compact the material. All surfaces of each
layer must receive at least two passes with the grousers. The dozers must
be operating continuously during the spreading process, even if this action
results in more than two passes. A front-end loader with operator must be
available to assist with depositing and spreading RCC as needed in confined
areas, at the abutments, and at other locations approved or directed. In
no case must the RCC, or bedding mortar be allowed to dry. Under no
conditions must a dozer or other tracked vehicle be operated on other than
fresh uncompacted RCC except at the start of each lift placement to
facilitate startup operations, and then only by an approved procedure. No
RCC or other concrete must be placed on a previous lift which has not met
specification. Unacceptable material must be removed.
3.2.5 Compaction/Consolidation
After spreading and working with the dozers, the top surface of each lift
must be compacted with a minimum of four, plus as many additional passes
with a self-propelled double-drum vibratory roller operating in the
vibratory mode as are required to obtain a minimum of 98 percent of the
theoretical density. A round trip over the same material must count as two
passes (i.e., from point A to point B and return to point A by the same
route is two passes). Rollers must not be operated in the vibratory mode
unless they are moving
SECTION 03 37 23.00 25 Page 31
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
3.2.5.1 Theoretical Density (TD) Determination
The TD is defined as the theoretical density (unit weight) of the concrete,
pounds per cubic foot, computed to including air content. The TD value to
be used during construction will be determined using job mixture
proportions and Contractor supplied materials; and, using compaction
techniques suitable for RCC, and following the appropriate testing
procedures used to determined theoretical unit weight of concrete as
described as in ASTM C138/C138M.
3.2.5.2 Required Compaction Density
All RCC must be compacted to a minimum of 98 percent of the TD value. The
anticipated TD, estimated from laboratory test data is approximately 160
pounds per cubic foot.
3.2.5.3 Density Determination of Compacted RCC
Density must be measured using a nuclear density meter in accordance with
ASTM C1040/C1040M. RCC density value determinations must be made
throughout the course of RCC placement to assure that the RCC is compacted
to a minimum 98 percent of the TD and detect segregation or voids
throughout the RCC. Submit findings of all tests as part of the Concrete
Strength Report.
3.2.5.4 Additional Compaction
If more than four passes are required to achieve the required density, the
additional passes must be made at no additional cost to the Government.
3.2.6 Lift Joints
The entire RCC mass must be placed with sufficient continuity so that it
hardens and acts as one monolithic block without discontinuous joints or
potential planes of separation. All lift joints must be kept clean,
uncontaminated, free from ponded water, and continuously moist until
placement of the succeeding RCC or other concrete.
3.2.6.1 Regular Lift-Joint Treatment
a. Lift joints that have not hardened or dried and are less than 72
hours old must be given the regular lift-joint treatment. Submit the
method and equipment proposed for joint cleanup and waste disposal for
review by the CO not later than 30 days after Notice to Proceed for
conformance with specifications. Regular lift-joint treatment and
maintenance must include:
(1) Maintaining 100 percent of each compacted lift-joint surface
continuously moist,
(2) If necessary, removing all loose contaminants or deteriorated
RCC by low-pressure washing or vacuuming, and
(3) Application of a 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick bedding mortar over the
entire placement surface area immediately before placement of the
next lift.
b. For regular lift-joint treatment, no washing or vacuuming will be
necessary provided damage or contamination of the lift surface is
SECTION 03 37 23.00 25 Page 32
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
prevented.
3.2.6.2 Cold Joints
a. A cold joint is any vertical or horizontal RCC surface:
(1) That does not receive the next RCC lift within 72 hours,
(2) In which the RCC has been allowed to dry, or
(3) That has been contaminated to the extent that contaminants
cannot be removed using low-pressure water.
b. Cold joints must be prepared for the next lift by the methods and
procedures in paragraph SURFACE PREPARATION above, prior to resumption
of RCC placement. Following this initial preparation, the cold-joint
surface must be kept continuously moist until application of the
bedding mortar. Whenever a cold joint at any edge or end of any lift
occurs, it must be located at least 30 feet from the location of other
cold joints that may have previously occurred in the same direction
along previous lifts.
3.2.6.3 Unplanned Cold Joints
Cold joints between adjacent placements of RCC must not be scheduled.
However, if an unplanned joint occurs, it must be treated as follows:
a. Unplanned Cold-Joints will be treated as described above.
Additionally they must be treated as described hereafter.
b. Shoulders must be broken down and feathered out such that the
vertical rise does not exceed the layer height for each horizontal
distance equal to the roller width, and
c. The hardened RCC surface must be prepared for receiving the next
layer of RCC by cleaning with air supplemented with water to remove all
loose material. RCC surfaces which are to receive additional concrete
are considered to be cold joints if the hardened RCC surface is over 72
hours old, or has been contaminated to the extent that contaminants
cannot be removed using low pressure water.
3.2.6.4 Vertical Joints
Joints for sloping, near-vertical or vertical RCC surfaces are considered
to be vertical joints. A vertical joint most often will occur when an RCC
placement is terminated before the entire RCC placement for that lift has
been completed. When it does become apparent that placement of RCC will be
terminated prior to completion of a lift, the RCC spreading procedure at
the leading zone of the placement must be adjusted to provide a gradual
tapered slope to complete that lift. The taper must be no steeper than 25
horizontal on one vertical. Where the tapered slope meets the underlying
hardened lift surface, care must be taken to prevent or remove any
segregated or uncompacted material. The tapered surface must be compacted
in accordance with paragraph COMPACTION/CONSOLIDATION above. Prior to
resumption of RCC placements, the tapered surface must be prepared in
accordance with paragraph SURFACE PREPARATION above.
SECTION 03 37 23.00 25 Page 33
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
3.2.7 Downstream Face
The downstream sloped face of the dam and the exposed slopes of the
stilling basin training walls must be constructed using sacrificial RCC on
1.0 vertical to 0.9 horizontal slope. The slope must be constructed to the
tolerances specified. Each RCC lift must be overbuilt at least 12 inches,
and it must subsequently be trimmed to the surface smoothness tolerance.
Trimming must be performed before the RCC is more than 48 hours old. The
process must be demonstrated during the test section. Trimming must be
done in such a manner to prevent damage to the surface and interior RCC.
3.3 CURING AND PROTECTION
Submit the curing media and methods to be used for review to the CO 14 days
before concrete placement begins for conformance with specifications.
3.3.1 Curing
The surface of every RCC lift must be kept continuously moist, commencing
immediately after compaction, by use of water trucks equipped with fog
sprayers for 14 days or until the surface is covered with the next lift.
Uncompacted sacrificial RCC, need not be cured. Concrete that is moist
cured must be maintained continuously, not periodically, wet for the
duration of the entire curing period. Water for curing must comply with
the requirements of paragraph entitled Water. If the water or mats cause
staining or discoloration of permanently exposed concrete surfaces, the
surfaces must be cleaned by a method approved by the CO. When wood or
metal forms are left in place during curing, the forms must be kept
continuously wet, except for sealed insulation curing in cold weather. RCC
may be cured with saturated cotton or burlap mats in lieu of the approved
fog spraying equipment. The RCC must meet a 7 day minimum compressive
strength of 2,500 psi prior to releasing water over the newly placed
concrete.
3.3.2 Hot-Weather Protection
When ambient air temperatures exceeds 90 degrees F and as soon as the
conventional concrete and RCC is sufficiently hard to withstand washing of
surface mortar, water by fog spraying must be applied in a controlled
manner to provide evaporative cooling. Water must be applied at such a
rate that it quickly evaporates and such that the surface remains
continuously moist without ponding. In addition, when surface materials
begin to dry and while the RCC placement, spreading, and compaction process
is still underway and until the concrete has sufficiently hardened to
permit the above water spray, hand-held fog spraying must be applied to the
concrete surfaces as directed to prevent drying out of concrete materials
and replace moisture lost to evaporation. These hot-weather protection
procedures will require additional labor(s) to assure complete coverage of
the entire surface areas to prevent unacceptable damage to the RCC and
conventional concrete. Submit a description of the materials and methods
proposed for protection of the concrete, when concrete is to be placed
under hot-weather conditions, to the CO for review 30 days in advance of
anticipated need date.

3.4.1 Finishing
The ambient temperature of spaces adjacent to surfaces being finished must
be not less than 50 degrees F. In hot weather when the rate of evaporation
of surface moisture, as determined by use of Figure 2.1.5 of ACI 305R, may
reasonably be expected to exceed 0.2 lb/sq ft per hour, provisions for
windbreaks, shading, fog spraying, or wet covering with a light-colored
material must be made in advance of placement, and such protective measures
must be taken as quickly as finishing operations will allow. All unformed
surfaces that are not to be covered by additional concrete or backfill must
have a float finish, unless a trowel finish is specified, and must be true
to the elevation shown. Surfaces to receive additional concrete or
backfill must be brought to the elevation shown in the drawings and left
true and regular. Exterior surfaces must be sloped for drainage unless
otherwise shown or as directed. Joints must be carefully made with a
jointing or edging tool. The finished surfaces must be protected from
stains or abrasions.
3.5 TESTS AND INSPECTIONS
3.5.1 General
Perform the inspection and tests as described below, and based upon the
results of these inspections and tests, he must take the action required
and submit reports as required. When, in the opinion of the CO, the
concreting operation is out of control, concrete placement must cease. The
laboratory performing the tests must be on-site and must conform with
ASTM C1077. The individuals who sample and test concrete or the
constituents of concrete as required in this specification must have
demonstrated a knowledge and ability to perform the necessary test
procedures equivalent to the ACI minimum guidelines for certification of
Concrete Field Testing Technicians, Grade I. The individual who performs
the inspection must have demonstrated a knowledge and ability equivalent to
SECTION 03 37 23.00 25 Page 35
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
the ACI minimum guidelines for certification of Concrete Construction
Inspector (CCI), Level II. The Government will inspect the laboratory,
equipment, and test procedures prior to start of concreting operations and
at least once per year thereafter for conformance with ASTM C1077.
3.5.2 Testing and Inspection Requirements
3.5.2.1 Fine Aggregate
3.5.2.1.1 Grading
At least once during each shift when the concrete plant is operating, there
must be one sieve analysis and fineness modulus determination in accordance
with ASTM C136/C136M, ASTM C117, and COE CRD-C 104 for the fine aggregate
or for each fine aggregate if it is batched in more than one size or
classification. The location at which samples are taken may be selected by
the Contractor as the most advantageous for control. However, the
Contractor is responsible for delivering fine aggregate to the mixer within
specification limits. The results must be recorded on a sheet on which are
also shown the specification limits applicable to the project.
3.5.2.1.2 Fineness-Modulus Control Chart
Results for fineness modulus must be grouped in sets of three consecutive
tests, and the average and range of each group must be plotted on a control
chart. The upper and lower control limits for average must be drawn 0.10
units above and below the target fineness modulus, and the upper control
limit for range must be 0.20.
3.5.2.1.3 Corrective Action for Fine Aggregate Grading
When the amount passing on any sieve is outside the specification limits,
the fine aggregate must be immediately resampled and retested. If there is
another failure on any sieve, the fact must immediately be reported to the
CO. Whenever a point on the fineness modulus control chart, either for
average or range, is beyond one of the control limits, the frequency of
testing must be doubled. If two consecutive points are beyond the control
limits, the process must be considered out of control and concreting must
be stopped. The CO must be notified, and immediate steps must be taken to
rectify the situation. After two consecutive points have fallen within the
control limits, testing at the normal frequency may be resumed.
3.5.2.1.4 Moisture Content Testing
When in the opinion of the CO the electric moisture meter is not operating
satisfactorily, there must be at least four tests for moisture content in
accordance with ASTM C566 during each eight hour period of mixing plant
operation. The times for the tests must be selected randomly within the
eight hour period. An additional test must be made whenever the slump is
out of control or excessive variation in workability is reported by the
placing foreman. When an electric moisture meter is operating
satisfactorily, at least two direct measurements of moisture content must
be made per week to check the calibration of the meter. The results of
tests for moisture content must be used to adjust the added water in the
control of the batch plant.
3.5.2.1.5 Moisture Content Corrective Action
Whenever the moisture content of the fine aggregate changes by 0.5 percent
SECTION 03 37 23.00 25 Page 36
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
or more from the previous sample, the scale settings for the fine aggregate
batcher and water batcher must be adjusted (directly or by means of a
moisture compensation device).
3.5.2.2 Coarse Aggregate
3.5.2.2.1 Grading
At least once during each shift in which the concrete plant is operating,
there must be a sieve analysis in accordance with ASTM C136/C136M for each
size of coarse aggregate. The location at which samples are taken may be
selected by the Contractor as the most advantageous for production
control. A test record of samples of aggregate taken at the same locations
must show the results of the current test as well as the average results of
the five most recent tests including the current test. The Contractor may
adopt limits for control coarser than the specification limits for samples
taken other than as delivered to the mixer to allow for degradation during
handling. When facilities are available to test samples five times as
large as those required in ASTM C136/C136M, no averaging must be done.
3.5.2.2.2 Corrective Action for Grading
When the amount passing any sieve is outside the specification limits, the
coarse aggregate must be immediately resampled and retested. If the second
sample fails on any sieve, that fact must be reported to the CO. Where two
consecutive averages of five tests (or two consecutive tests where large
samples are used) are outside specification limits, the operation must be
considered out of control, and that fact must be reported to the CO,
concreting must be stopped, and immediate steps must be taken to correct
the grading.
3.5.2.2.3 Coarse Aggregate Moisture Content
A test for moisture content of each size group of coarse aggregate must be
made at least once a shift. When two consecutive readings for smallest
size coarse aggregate differ by more than one percent, frequency of testing
must be increased to that specified previously for fine aggregate.
3.5.2.2.4 Coarse Aggregate Moisture Corrective Action
Whenever the moisture content of any size of coarse aggregate changes by
0.5 percent or more from the previous sample, the scale setting for the
coarse aggregate batcher and the water batcher must be adjusted to
compensate for this.
3.5.2.2.5 Material Finer than the No. 200 Sieve
When in the opinion of the CO, a problem exists in connection with the
cleanliness of the coarse aggregate, tests must be made in accordance with
ASTM C117. Testing frequency must be as directed.
3.5.2.2.6 Corrective Action for material finer than the No. 200 Sieve
When material finer than the No. 200 sieve exceeds one percent of the
weight of the coarse aggregate finer than 1 1/2 inch or 0.5 percent of the
weight of the aggregate coarser than 1 1/2 inch, the CO must be notified,
and steps, such as washing or other corrective action, must be initiated
immediately.
SECTION 03 37 23.00 25 Page 37
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
3.5.2.3 Quality of Aggregates
3.5.2.3.1 Frequency of Quality Tests
Prior to submitting samples for mixture proportioning studies, perform the
tests for aggregate quality in the following list. In addition, after the
start of concrete placement, perform tests for aggregate quality during
concrete or aggregate production, in accordance with the following
frequency schedule. Samples tested after the start of concrete placement
must be taken immediately prior to entering the concrete mixer.
FREQUENCY
PROPERTY FINE AGGREGATE COARSE
AGGREGATE
TEST

ASTM C128
Absorption Every 30 Days Every 30 Days ASTM C127
ASTM C128
Flat and Elongate Not applicable Every 30 Days ASTM D4791
3.5.2.3.2 Corrective Action for Aggregate Quality
If the result of a quality test fails to meet the requirements for quality
during submittal of samples for mixture-proportioning studies or
immediately prior to start of concrete placement, production procedures or
materials must be changed and additional tests must be performed until the
material meets the quality requirements prior to proceeding with either
mixture-proportioning studies or starting concrete placement. After
concrete placement commences, whenever the result of a test for quality
fails the requirements, the test must be rerun immediately. If the second
test fails the quality requirement, the fact must be reported to the CO and
immediate steps taken to rectify the situation.
3.5.2.4 Compressive Strength Testing
At least one set of test specimens will be made each day on each different
mixture placed during each shift. Additional sets of test cylinders will
be made, as directed by the CO, when the mixture proportions are changed or
when low strengths have been detected. A random sampling plan will be
developed and approved by the CO prior to the start of construction.
Sampling must be random in accordance with the requirements of ASTM D3665.
A set of test specimens for concrete with a 90-day strength will consist of
six cylinders, two tested at seven days, two at 28 days, and two at 90 days.
Test specimens will be 6 inch diameter by 12 inches, molded in accordance
with ASTM C1176/1176M or ASTM C1435/C1435M, protected and cured in
accordance with ASTM C31/C31M, and tested in accordance with ASTM C39/C39M.
All compressive-strength tests will be reported immediately to the CO.
Quality control charts must be kept for individual strength tests, moving
average for strength, and moving average for range for each mixture. The
charts must be similar to those found in ACI 214R.
3.5.2.5 Vebe Consistency
For each set of strength specimens as described above a Vebe Consistency in
accordance with ASTM C1170/C1170M must be completed. Both the Vebe time
SECTION 03 37 23.00 25 Page 38
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
and Density must be reported as part of the Contractor's Quality Control
Program.
3.5.2.6 Scales
3.5.2.6.1 Weighing Accuracy
The accuracy of the scales must be checked by test weights at least once a
month for conformance with the applicable requirements of paragraphs BATCH
PLANT and CONTINUOUS MIXING PLANT both in PART 2. Such tests must also be
made as directed whenever there are variations in properties of the fresh
concrete that could result from batching errors.
3.5.2.6.2 Batching and Recording Accuracy
Once a week the accuracy of each batching and recording device must be
checked during a weighing operation by noting and recording the required
weight, recorded weight, and the actual weight batched. Confirm that the
calibration devices described in paragraph BATCH PLANT in PART 2 for
checking the accuracy of dispensed admixtures are operating properly. If a
continuous mixing plant is provided, the accuracy and operation of all
feeding and dispensing units must be checked before the start of operation
each day.
3.5.2.6.3 Scales Corrective Action
When the weighing accuracy or batching accuracy does not comply with
specification requirements, the plant must not be operated until necessary
adjustments or repairs have been made. Discrepancies in recording
accuracies must be corrected immediately.
3.5.2.7 Concrete Plant Control
The measurement of all constituent materials including cementitious
materials, each size of aggregate, water, and admixtures must be
continuously controlled. The aggregate weights and amount of added water
must be adjusted as necessary to compensate for free moisture in the
aggregates. A report must be prepared indicating type and source of cement
used, type and source of pozzolan or slag used, amount and source of
admixtures used, aggregate source, the required aggregate and water weights
per cubic yard, amount of water as free moisture in each size of aggregate,
and the as-mixed aggregate and water weights per cubic yard for each class
of concrete placed during plant operation.
3.5.2.8 Field Density
3.5.2.8.1 Testing and Checking
Density must be determined for at least eight locations per RCC lift with a
calibrated nuclear density gauge in accordance with ASTM C1040/C1040M.
Densities must be taken at depths of 4 and 8 inches. If the densities at 4
and 8 inches conflict, acceptance must be at the 8 inch depth.
3.5.2.8.2 Action Required
Whenever the nuclear gauge indicates density less than the specified
density, a retest must be made. If the retest indicates unacceptable
density, the CO's Representative must be notified, additional rolling must
be immediately provided, and a determination must be made as to whether the
SECTION 03 37 23.00 25 Page 39
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
lower density resulted from insufficient passes of the roller or a change
in the mix properties. If the mix properties have changed, adjustments
such as increasing or decreasing the moisture content must be made at the
batch plant. If the problem persists, the CO may adjust the proportions of
aggregates, cement, and pozzolan. If the lower density is the result of
incomplete rolling, the operator must be notified and the CO may require
removal of the incompletely compacted material at no cost to the Government.
3.5.2.9 Inspection Before Placing
Foundation or construction joints, forms, and embedded items must be
inspected in sufficient time prior to each concrete placement to certify to
the CO that they are ready to receive concrete. The results of each
inspection must be reported in writing. The inspection of the lift
surfaces of the RCC will be a continuing activity and must be accomplished
in accordance with paragraph REGULAR LIFT-JOINT TREATMENT above.
3.5.2.10 Placing Inspection
3.5.2.10.1 Inspection
Provide full time supervision of all placing operations to insure that the
correct quality of RCC, conventional concrete, or grout is placed in each
location and that all other aspects of the placing operation are performed
in accordance with the Contract. During placing operations, the quality
control staff must measure and record concrete temperatures in accordance
with ASTM C1064/C1064M, ambient temperature hourly, record weather
conditions, time of placement, yardage placed, and method of placement.
3.5.2.10.2 Corrective Action
The placing foreman must not permit placing to begin until he has verified
that an adequate number of vibrators, spreaders, and compactors in working
order and with competent operators are available. Placing must not be
continued if any conventional concrete is inadequately consolidated or if
any lift of RCC is not fully compacted. Additional compaction, if
necessary, must be performed in accordance with paragraph ADDITIONAL
COMPACTION above. If any batch of conventional concrete fails to meet the
temperature requirements, immediate steps must be taken to improve
temperature controls.
3.5.2.11 Vibrator Tests
3.5.2.11.1 Vibrator Testing and Use
The frequency and amplitude of each vibrator must be determined in
accordance with COE CRD-C 521 prior to initial use and at least once a
month when concrete is being placed. Additional tests must be made as
directed when a vibrator does not appear to be adequately consolidating the
concrete. The frequency must be determined while the vibrator is operating
in concrete with the tachometer being held against the upper end of the
vibrator head while almost submerged and just before the vibrator is
withdrawn from the concrete. The amplitude must be determined with the
head vibrating in air. Two measurements must be taken, one near the tip
and another near the upper end of the vibrator head, and these results
averaged. The make, model, type, and size of the vibrator and frequency
and amplitude results must be reported in writing. In addition, the
self-propelled vibratory rollers, as specified in PART 2, paragraph PRIMARY
ROLLERS, must be checked for frequency and amplitude prior to use and once
SECTION 03 37 23.00 25 Page 40
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
every three months when RCC is being placed.
3.5.2.11.2 Vibrator Corrective Action
Any vibrator not meeting the requirements of paragraph VIBRATORS must be
immediately removed from service and repaired or replaced.
3.5.2.12 Curing Inspection
3.5.2.12.1 Moist Curing Inspections
At least twice each shift, and twice per day on nonwork days an inspection
must be made of all areas subject to moist curing. The surface moisture
condition must be noted and recorded.
3.5.2.12.2 Moist Curing Corrective Action
When a daily inspection report lists an area of inadequate curing,
immediate corrective action must be taken, and the required curing period
for those areas must be extended by one day.
3.5.2.13 Cold-Weather and Hot-Weather Protection
At least once each shift and once per day on nonwork days an inspection
must be made of all areas subject to cold-weather or hot-weather
protection. Any deficiencies must be noted, corrected, and reported.
3.5.2.14 Cold-Weather and Hot-Weather Protection Corrective Action
When a daily inspection report lists deficiencies, the deficiency must be
corrected immediately and the period of protection extended for one day.
3.5.3 Reports
All results of tests or inspections conducted must be reported informally
as they are completed and in writing daily. A weekly report must be
prepared for the updating of control charts covering the entire period from
the start of the construction season through the current week. During
periods of cold-weather protection, reports of pertinent temperatures must
be made daily. These requirements do not relieve the Contractor of the
obligation to report certain failures immediately as required in preceding
paragraphs. Such reports of failures and the action taken must be
confirmed in writing in the routine reports. The CO has the right to
examine all Contractor quality control records.

This Section specifies ready-mix Controlled Low Strength Material (CLSM)
for the following applications:
Filling of the 30 pipes and entire valve pit located in the Outlet
Works structure to be abandoned.
1.3 DEFINITIONS
a. Ready-mix CLSM is used for utility pipe backfill, and is also known
as controlled density fill or flowable fill as defined in ACI 229R.
CLSM differs from Portland cement concrete as it contains a low
cementitious content to reduce strength development for possible future
removal. Chemical admixtures may also be used in CLSM to modify
performance properties of strength, flow, set and hydraulic
conductivity. Pumpable mixes are available.
b. CLSM must have compressive strength properties per Paragraph MIX
COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH below.
1.4 SUBMITTALS
Government approval is required for submittals with a "G" designation;
submittals not having a "G" designation are for information only. When
used, a designation following the "G" designation identifies the office
that will review the submittal for the Government. Submit the following in

RIVER DIVERSION
PART 1 GENERAL
1.1 GENERAL INFORMATION
This Section covers river diversion during construction. The exact methods
for river diversion are not specified. The river diversion methods are the
responsibility of the Contractor. Follow the performance requirements
specified in this Section for river diversion.
1.2 SUBMITTALS
Government approval is required for submittals with a "G" designation;
submittals not having a "G" designation are for information only. Submit
the following in accordance with Section 01 33 00, SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES:
SD-01 Preconstruction Submittals
River Diversion Plan; G
SD-05 Design Data
Cofferdam Design; G
SD-06 Test Reports
River Diversion Report
1.3 FLOW DATA
a. Attachment A6, shows daily average discharge curves for various
exceedance values. Discharge data for USGS gage 14240525, NF Toutle
River Below SRS Near Kid Valley, WA, can be found here:
http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?14240525.
b. The Northwest River Forecast Center provides flow forecasts for the
main stem Toutle River at the Tower Road bridge. These forecasts can
be found at the following location:
http://www.nwrfc.noaa.gov/river/station/flowplot/flowplot.cgi?TOTW1.
c. Significant rainfall-runoff driven flow events are rare during the
in-water-work-period, but they have occurred within the gage record.
The river forecast can be one way of staying informed if flows are
expected to change. Be aware that forecast data is uncertain and may
under or over predict flows or potentially miss an event entirely. If
a rainfall event occurs, a change in flow and water surface elevation
will likely follow shortly.
1.4 RIVER DIVERSION PLAN
Submit a River Diversion Plan. Submit 30 days prior to start of river
diversion work. Describe the Contractor's river diversion system for the
duration of the project, including, as a minimum: cofferdams, culverts, and
SECTION 30 00 01.00 25 Page 2
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
other river diversion features; the discharge of the North Fork Toutle
River that the river diversion system is designed to accommodate without
flooding the worksite; potential seepage and methods that will be used to
handle such seepage; methods for maintaining the minimum discharge for
river continuity; methods for maintaining the minimum flow depth; and a
statement of concurrence with the River Diversion Plan by the Contractor's
professional engineer. In addition, include drawings and figures to
illustrate the plan visually. If the Contractor elects to install culverts
within the RCC structure, include in the River Diversion Plan all aspects
of the activity, including the type(s) of culverts, the plan for
installation, and the plan for filling with concrete upon completion of
use. A Construction photo of the temporary works developed in 2012 is
included in Drawing C-008 Care and Diversion of Water During Construction.
The drawing illustrates areas that can be used for diversion and those that
cannot.
1.5 PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER
A registered professional engineer must design the river diversion system.
The professional engineer must concur with the River Diversion Plan. The
professional engineer must inspect the river diversion system during
initial construction, whenever there is a change in configuration, and
during high river flow events. The professional engineer must produce a
River Diversion Report for each site visit documenting all observations,
recommendations, and updates to the river diversion system. The
professional engineer must be available to meet with the Contracting
Officer at any time throughout the Contract duration. Update the River
Diversion Plan and re-submit with any changes. Submit no later than one
day after each site visit by professional engineer.
PART 2 PRODUCTS
Not Used.
PART 3 EXECUTION
3.1 COFFERDAMS AND CULVERTS
a. The Contractor may construct cofferdams and use culverts as
necessary for the river diversion system. As a minimum, the river
diversion system must be capable of passing a river discharge of 860
cubic feet per second without flooding the worksite. This flow has a
10 percent chance of exceedance in any given year between July 1 to
September 30. Extending the work any later would likely experience
increased flows and affect the Contractor's design.
b. The Contractor is allowed to install steel or concrete culverts
within the RCC structure, for the purpose of river diversion, as long
as the following requirements are met:
(1) The culverts are strong enough to support the loads from the
RCC structure during the river diversion time period.
(2) No RCC compacted against the culverts below their springline.
(3) Place a minimum of two feet of conventional concrete, with a
compressive strength no less than 3,000 pounds per square inch,
around the culverts below their springline.
SECTION 30 00 01.00 25 Page 3
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
(4) Culverts are anchored down to prevent flotation during
concrete placement below the springline.
(5) Upon completion of the river diversion time period, completely
fill all culverts installed within the RCC structure with concrete
with compressive strength of no less than 3,000 pounds per square
inch.
c. The existing outlet works pipes may not be used for river
diversion. River diversion must occur within the existing spillway
channel.
d. Cofferdams must be designed by a licensed professional engineer in
the State of Washington. Cofferdams must be designed according to
USACE manuals and regulations cited in the Paragraph REFERENCES.
Submit cofferdam design for review. Submit at least 30 days prior to
IWW for review. Include all relevant sketches, shop drawings, and
calculations packages. Designs must be peer reviewed by an independent
technical reviewer with supporting documentation of that review
provided in the package. Cofferdams designed and constructed as part
of temporary works must have any features not consisting of earth
materials removed from the spillway and sediment plain.
3.2 SEEPAGE
Consider the potential for seepage through cofferdams and through the rock
foundation beneath cofferdams. Design the river diversion system to
prevent potential seepage from disrupting construction activities, by
minimizing or collecting such potential seepage.
3.3 MINIMUM DISCHARGE FOR RIVER CONTINUITY
During transitions in river diversions, maintain a minimum discharge of 50
cubic feet per second of the North Fork Toutle River from the upstream
reservoir to the downstream channel. The location of the discharge along
the existing spillway crest may vary during construction. Measure the
discharge in the North Fork Toutle River at the USGS gage 14240525 located
at the Fish Collection Facility downstream of the Sediment Retention
Structure. Pumping water for river diversion is not allowed in order to
protect any fish that may be migrating downstream while the river diversion
system is in place. During this minimum discharge, the number of culvert
pipes may need to be limited to assure minimum depth criteria (next
paragraph) is met.
3.4 MINIMUM FLOW DEPTH
Except for transitions described above, maintain a discharge of 340 cfs and
a minimum flow depth of one foot to provide passage for any fish that may
be migrating downstream while the Contractor's river diversion system is in
place. A siphon is an acceptable method to pass fish and water.
Contractor may cut slots through the RCC baffles of the first raise for
pipe access. The combination of number and size of pipes must not cause
the flow depths to run below minimum depth in the pipes at the median
discharge 340 cfs during construction season.
3.5 DIVERSION CONNECTIVITY TO EXISTING LOW FLOW CHANNEL
The river flows down the existing seven foot RCC crest raise wedge to the
existing excavated low channel. No flow must be diverted southwest of the
SECTION 30 00 01.00 25 Page 4
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
dashed line (i.e. No Diversion Area) shown on the Contract Drawings
(C-007). Any means of piping, channeling, or berm is acceptable as long as
there is no stranding of the fish. Clearance of woody vegetation along the
conveyance route is required.
3.6 FISH RESCUE
Provide Fisheries Biologists or Biological Technicians during construction
of the coffer dam and river division to rescue and relocate any stranded
fish. Any stranded fish will be rescued immediately and returned directly
back into the river.
3.7 DEMOBILIZATION
Prior to demobilization from the site, all man-made components of the river
diversion system must be removed and must remain the property of the
Contractor. Earth materials used in cofferdams may remain in place,
however, cofferdam material above the elevation of the crest of the low
flow channel must be removed.

3.2 CONDUIT INSTALLATION
3.2.1 General
The conduit installation must include all conduit, boxes, and necessary
fittings. The necessary precautions must be exercised to prevent the
entrance and lodgment of grout, concrete, dirt, plaster, or trash in
conduit, fittings, and boxes during the course of installation. Conduit
that has been crushed or deformed in any way must not be installed. Bends
and offsets in rigid conduit must be made with a conduit bending machine
only. Electrical continuity of the conduit system must be maintained.
Damaged galvanized surfaces must be repaired with galvanizing repair
compound. All installed empty conduit must be provided with an approved
nylon pull rope with tensile strength in accordance with Paragraph
entitled, PULL CABLES. Conduit runs between devices or boxes must contain
no more than the equivalent of three 90 degree bends, including those
located immediately at the outlet or fitting.
3.2.2 Exposed Conduit
All exposed conduit runs must be rigid galvanized steel. EMT and IMC
conduit must not be used. Exposed conduit must be installed to avoid
interference with other work. Structural steel must not be cut, drilled or
bent to avoid interference except with written approval. Exposed conduit
must be installed to conform to the shape of the surface over which it is
run and must be installed parallel or perpendicular to walls, structural
members, or intersections of vertical planes and ceilings. Diagonal runs
must be avoided. Supports must be used at entrance or exit from all
conduit fittings, boxes, cabinets and changes of direction of conduit.
Bolts, pipe straps, and all other supporting hardware for exposed conduit
must be hot dip galvanized after fabrication. Supports for exposed conduit
on concrete surfaces must be fastened securely to the concrete with
concrete anchors. Wooden, fibrous, or similar plugs inserted into the
concrete will not be accepted. Powder driven guns must not be used for
embedded anchors.
3.2.3 Cutting and Threading

All cuts must be made with an approved hacksaw or a cutter type tool.
Roller type pipe cutters must not be used on conduits. All cuts must be
square and must not decrease the conduit opening. Conduit ends must be
reamed to remove burrs. All cuttings, dirt and oil must be removed from
the interior of the conduit. Threads must be clean cut. No running
threads will be permitted. Conduit unions or Erickson type couplings must
be used where standard couplings cannot be used. If Erickson couplings are
SECTION 30 00 10.00 25 Page 5
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
used, care must be used in their installation and they must be wrapped with
one half lapped layer of tape to prevent loosening by vibration.
3.2.3.2 Thread Compound
Conduit joints and connections must be made watertight and rustproof by the
application of a blend of colloidal copper and rust inhibitors. Each
threaded joint must be thoroughly cleaned to remove all cutting oil before
the compound is applied.
3.2.4 Bends
Wherever possible, bends in conduit runs must have a radius of not less
than ten times the diameter nominal size. All bends must be free from
cracks and indentations. Conduit elbows must be long radius.
3.2.5 Coordination
The conduit must be installed in the most direct and workmanlike manner so
that interference between conduit, existing instrumentation, and structural
features will be avoided. In case interference does develop, the
Government will decide which work must be relocated regardless of which
work was first installed. The rerouting must be made without additional
cost to the Government. Previously installed work must be examined prior
to developing layout and installation plans for conduit and accessories to
determine that installation can be made without interference with other
work.
3.2.6 Termination of Conduit
Each conduit must be securely fastened to sheet metal boxes and cabinets
with locknuts. Sealing locknuts must be used for outdoor enclosures. A
cast insulated bushing must be provided on each conduit. Plastic bushings
will not be used. The conduit must be of such length that when the bushing
is screwed tight against the end of the conduits, no appreciable space will
be left between bushing and locknut. The locknuts must be tightened
without deforming the box. Cast conduit hubs with a sealing gasket will be
permitted in lieu of the locknut and bushing combination.
3.2.7 Grounding of Conduit
All grounding connections to conduit must be made by means of grounding
bushings or by pressure type connectors. The entire metallic conduit
system must be electrically continuous. Conduits terminating at cabinets
must be grounded at the equipment by grounding bushings connected to the
grounding system by a No. 8 wire. Conduit runs must be grounded at both
ends.
3.2.8 Conduit Inspection
a. After an exposed conduit system is installed, or after conduit has
been placed and prior to placement of roller-compacted concrete, it
will be given a visual inspection and, if directed, a mandrel must be
drawn through the conduit in the presence of the COR. Should the
mandrel fail to pass through the conduit, a new bend or length of
conduit must be installed at the points of obstruction.
b. Conduit systems must be installed as indicated. Only metal conduits
will be permitted unless otherwise noted. Bushings or manufactured

A pull cable must be inserted in each empty conduit. The pull cable must
be of polypropylene having not less than 1000 pounds tensile strength. Not
less than 36 inches of slack must be left at each end of the pull wire.
3.2.10 Changes in Directions of Runs
Changes in direction of runs must be made with symmetrical bends or pull
boxes. Field-made bends and offsets must be made with an approved
conduit-bending machine. Crushed or deformed raceways will not be
installed. Trapped raceways in damp and wet locations must be avoided
where possible. Care must be taken to prevent the lodgment of dirt, or
trash in raceways, boxes, fittings, and equipment during the course of
construction. Clogged raceways must be entirely freed of obstructions or
must be replaced.
3.2.11 Expansion Fittings
Expansion fittings must be installed in exposed conduit runs, every 100
feet maximum, and at all crossings of concrete expansion joints. Expansion
fittings must be of the weatherproof type and must be furnished with an
external bonding jumper.
3.2.12 Supports
Conduits must be securely and rigidly fastened in place at intervals of not
more 10 feet and within 3 feet of boxes, cabinets, and fittings unless
otherwise noted on the plans. Individual conduits must be mounted with
hot-dip galvanized straps and clamp backs clear of the surface over which
they are run. Avoid cutting the reinforcing bars when drilling holes for
support anchors. Holes drilled for support anchors, but not used, must be
filled.
3.2.13 Conduit Buried in Earth and Roadway Crossings
Conduit that is buried in earth must be placed with no less than 18 inches
of coverage. In the case where buried conduit crosses an asphalt roadway,
excavate and backfill pavement repair areas according to M41-10, Division 5

EXCAVATION AND FILL
PART 1 GENERAL
1.1 GENERAL INFORMATION
a. Excavation and fill activities required for this Contract must
include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Excavation and removal of alluvial sediments on the existing
bedrock surface of the spillway. Additional specifications for
alluvial sediment removal are provided in Section 31 60 00.00 25,
FOUNDATION PREPARATION.
(2) Excavation and placement of alluvial sediments immediately
upstream of the existing bedrock spillway to construct temporary
low flow channels for care and diversion of the river flows.
Additional specifications for river diversion are provided in
Section 30 00 01.00 25, RIVER DIVERSION.
(3) Excavation of bedrock for the plunge pool. The excavated rock
must be stockpiled in designated areas illustrated on the plans
provided.
(4) Locally sourced cohesionless materials may be used for
subgrade materials to the apron constructed along the permanent
access road, otherwise imported materials meeting specifications
may also be used.
b. Care and diversion of the river are not covered under this Section.
Specifications for river diversion activities are provided in Section
30 00 01.00 25, RIVER DIVERSION.
1.2 EXISTING FOUNDATION EXPLORATION INFORMATION AND SPILLWAY SURVEY DATA
See Section 31 60 00.00 25, FOUNDATION PREPARATION, for existing foundation
exploration information. In addition, the Informational Drawings include
as-constructed drawings from the 1997 spillway erosion repair Contract,
including survey data of the existing spillway. For the basalt rock, the
average uniaxial compressive strength is 20,000 pounds per square inch and
the seismic p-wave velocity ranges from 11,500 to 15,000 feet per second.
Contractor may use p-wave velocity to correlate rip-ability of rock
excavation equipment.
1.3 DEFINITIONS
1.3.1 Alluvial Soils
Soils pertaining to or composed of alluvium, or deposited by a stream or
running water.
1.3.2 Hard Materials
Weathered rock, dense consolidated deposits, or conglomerate materials
SECTION 31 23 00.00 25 Page 2
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
which are not included in the definition of "rock" but which usually
require the use of heavy excavation equipment, ripper teeth, or jack
hammers for removal. Blasting was not required for the first spillway
raise and we do not expect the need for blasting the plunge pool excavation
for the second raise.
1.3.3 Rock
Solid homogeneous interlocking crystalline material with firmly cemented,
laminated, or foliated masses or conglomerate deposits, none of which can
be removed without use of backhoe-mounted pneumatic hole punchers or rock
breakers. The rock conditions expected to be encountered are described in
the boring logs attached.

3.2 SURFACE PREPARATION
3.2.1 Clearing and Grubbing
Clearing and grubbing requires removal of all vegetation and sediment down
to underlying bedrock where the RCC and rock excavation will be performed.
Remove trees, stumps, logs, shrubs, brush and vegetation, and other items
within the minimum footprint and along the water diversion conveyance
route. Dispose of the vegetation in compliance with all State and local
ordinances. There are no requirements for chipping or maximum size of
vegetation.
3.2.2 Stripping
Strip suitable soil from the site where excavation or grading is indicated
and stockpile separately from other excavated material. Material
unsuitable for use as topsoil must be wasted. Locate topsoil so that the
material can be used readily for the finished grading. Protect topsoil and
keep in segregated piles until needed.
3.2.3 Unsuitable Material
Remove vegetation, debris, decayed vegetable matter, sod, mulch, and
rubbish.
3.3 EXCAVATION AND MATERIALS
a. Excavate to contours, elevation, and dimensions indicated. The
tolerance for rock excavation must be minus 6 inches. Excavations
below indicated depths will not be permitted except to remove
unsatisfactory material. Unsatisfactory material encountered below the
grades shown must be removed as directed. Determination of elevations
and measurements of approved overdepth excavation of unsatisfactory
material below grades indicated must be done under the direction of the
CO.
b. Alluvial materials may be reused for river diversion purposes.
Also, bedrock materials from the first raise excavations were
stockpiled at one of the sites indicated on the drawings. These bed
rock materials may be used for temporary cofferdams.
c. Material excavated from the plunge pool for the second raise should
similarly be hauled and placed back to the same stock pile or other
site approved by the CO. Do not mix waste materials with excavated
rock materials. Maintain heavy equipment access to the stockpiled rock
material, for Government use, after this project is complete.
d. Alluvial materials imported crushed gravels may be used as subgrade
for the apron built for widening the access road. The materials must
be cohesionless. Perform a proof roll on the subgrade prior to placing
any RCC. The proof roll should consist of using the same roller to
compact the RCC. If the subgrade deflects or pumps the material must
be excavated and replaced.
e. The use of blasting is not allowed for any excavation.

1.5 FOUNDATION REPORT
Foundation conditions for the first spillway structure are found in
Attachment A7 - Foundation Report First Raise.
1.6 DEFINITIONS
1.6.1 Foundations
The rock foundation is comprised of the rock surfaces and concrete filled
joints, upon which the RCC layers must be placed. Vertical surfaces, where
permitted or required by these specifications, are included.
1.6.2 Rock Joints
a. Rock joints are all planar or curvilinear fractures, including
cracks, crevices, and seams which separate a rock mass into individual
rock blocks of various sizes. They may be open or closed and may be
filled with material other than rock material.
b. It is anticipated that a joint filled with concrete must effectively
act as a leveling course in localized areas and facilitate placing the
RCC. The joint filling is not intended to cutoff all seepage.
c. There may be a requirement to overexcavate the rock surface (1H:1V)
exposed by excavation between the plunge pool and the toe of the RCC
structure. The Contracting Officer (CO) or their designate will
perform an inspection of the rock surface and determine if the exposed
jointing requires the additional excavation. The requirements for
overexcavation are specified below in Paragraph FOUNDATION EXCAVATION.
d. Width, depth and the weathering conditions of existing rock joint
conditions are unknown. Rock conditions are determined by rock type,
degree of weathering, and the method of rock excavation. Previous
crest raise work did not encounter rock that required removal and
replacement with dental concrete. Descriptions of foundation rock and
quality are provided in the 2012 report which includes an annotated
plan sheet with field mapped geologic conditions.
1.6.3 Baseline Conditions
Geotechnical boring logs are provided with the Informational Drawings. The
foundation conditions encountered are expected to be similar to that
described in the borings and that documented in the first spillway raise.
See attached Foundation Report First Raise (FOR INFORMATION ONLY).
a. Massive flow breccias
b. Highly fractured basalt
SECTION 31 60 00.00 25 Page 3
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
c. Fragmented rock with less than 50 percent sediment
d. Fragmented rock with more than 50 percent sediment
PART 2 PRODUCTS
2.1 MATERIALS
Dental concrete must conform to the requirements of ASTM C387/C387M, normal
weight and strength. This is often referred to as a "sand mix" and
intended to fill cracks less than 2 inches wide.
2.2 EQUIPMENT
Tools. Submit for approval tabular list of light power tools, to be used in
lieu of hand tools, prior to their use on the job site. Hand tools, where
required or permitted by these specifications include, but are not limited
to: shovels, bars, picks, wedges, and brooms. Light power tools may be
used in lieu of hand tools only when such use is approved. Below is a list
of appropriate jetting tools for cleaning rock joints. Select one that is
appropriate and submit details for information only.
2.2.1 Air Jet
An air jet must consist of a 1-1/2 inch nozzle with a supply hose connected
to a suitable source of compressed air. The compressed air must have a
pressure between 90 and 110 psi. The compressed air must be controllable
at the nozzle.
2.2.2 Air/Water Jet
An air/water jet must consist of a 1-1/2 inch nozzle with associated
controls and supply hoses connected to suitable sources of compressed air
and water. Compressed air must have a pressure between 90 and 110 psi.
Water must be introduced into the airstream at the nozzle when needed, at a
rate of up to 30 gpm. The air and water must be separately controllable at
the nozzle.
2.2.3 Water Jet
A water jet must consist of a one inch nozzle with a supply hose connected
to a suitable source of water. The system must be capable of delivering up
to 200 gpm. The flow rate must be controllable at the nozzle.
PART 3 EXECUTION
3.1 EXAMINATION
The limits of the proposed foundation treatment are approximately as
indicated by the outline on the Contract Drawings. The CO reserves the
right to change the depth to, or the width of, the foundations if
conditions exposed in the foundation excavations warrant such modifications.
3.2 PRELIMINARY CLEANUP
When the CO determines that satisfactory foundation joint cleaning has been
reached, the CO may direct that a preliminary cleanup be performed on all
or any part of the rock foundation surface. This cleanup will consist of
SECTION 31 60 00.00 25 Page 4
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
removing all debris, loose rock, sand, silt, and other objectionable
material by hand tools followed by water jets or any combination of
additional methods approved or directed. The CO may require that the
excavation be continued and the preliminary cleanup procedure repeated
until a satisfactory foundation surface is reached. For example, in areas
where the excavation to grade line exposes fragmented rock with more than
50 percent sediment as described in Paragraph BASELINE CONDITIONS item (d),
immediately notify the CO for guidance on continued excavation and
replacement with RCC.
3.3 FINAL CLEANUP AND FOUNDATION PREPARATION
Unless otherwise directed, Final Cleanup and Foundation Preparation must be
performed on the spillway surface. This work must consist of removing
loose rock and pockets of fines, sand, rock rubble or gravel and other
objectionable material from the in place rock surface including areas of
depression, large crevices, and open rock joints. The loose material need
not be removed where the width of the opening is less than 0.5 inches.
Mechanical equipment may be used. Picking, barring, and hand excavation
may be necessary to obtain a foundation surface free from loose, drummy, or
shattered materials. The final rock surface must be thoroughly cleaned by
use of jets or other approved method and must be maintained in a clean
condition until the placement of concrete thereon. The final rock surface
must fall into one of the top three categories of expected base line
condition See Paragraph BASELINE CONDITIONS items (a), (b), or (c). The
last category item (d) is unacceptable. Upon completion of final clean up
the, complete a topographic survey of the rock surface as specified in
Sections 01 71 23.16 25, CONSTRUCTION SURVEYING, and 01 78 39.10 25
AS-BUILT DRAWINGS.
3.4 DENTAL TREATMENT
3.4.1 General
a. Dental treatment consists of excavation, if necessary, of the
material in joints, cavities, depressions, and the placement of
concrete such that the final surface is satisfactory for the subsequent
placement of RCC. The Dental Concrete Mix Design must have a low
enough slump to penetrate into the minimum width joints - see below.
b. The minimum width of joint excavation is 0.5 inches. Joints and
cavities must be excavated to a depth three times the width, measured
at the base of the excavation, of the joint or cavity. A minimum cure
time of 12 hours on the concrete is required.
3.4.2 Dental Concrete
Concrete must be used to fill joints, cavities, and depressions. Prior to
placement, the surfaces of the joint, cavity, and depression must be
thoroughly cleaned using jets. The maximum aggregate size in the concrete
must be 0.19 inch, or captured on a No. 10 sieve. The concrete must
conform with Paragraph MATERIALS.
3.5 TESTS
Establish and maintain quality control for foundation preparation
operations to assure compliance with Contract specifications and maintain
records of the quality control for all operations including but not limited
to the following:
SECTION 31 60 00.00 25 Page 5
MSH SEDIMENT RETENTION STRUCTURE CREST RAISE
3.5.1 Foundation Excavation
a. Strict adherence to foundation excavation limits and depths will be
required.
b. The CO will inspect the excavation for the plunge pool. Based upon
that inspection, the CO may direct overexcavation of the upstream face
of the plunge pool. The excavation the 2:1 slopes must be 8 feet wide
measured perpendicular to the face of the of the plunge pool. The
length of the excavation parallel to the plunge pool face will be
determined by the CO during the excavation, otherwise the RCC must be a
minimum of 2 feet thick.
c. The overexcavated portion of the plunge pool will be replaced with
concrete according to the specifications outlined in Section
03 37 23.00 25, ROLLER-COMPACTED CONCRETE FOR MASS CONCRETE
CONSTRUCTION.
3.5.2 Reports
Submit three copies of these Records of Inspection for Excavation as well
as corrective action taken daily.
3.6 FOUNDATION INSPECTION AND GEOLOGIC MAPPING
Inspections to determine adequacy of the foundations will be performed by
the CO in all foundation areas between completion of excavation and
placement of dental concrete. Cooperate to the extent necessary to assist
in inspection and mapping activities which may require additional survey
control points and access. Provide a minimum of 30 days advanced notice to
the CO prior to the foundation excavation and preliminary cleanup to ensure
that personnel who will perform the foundation inspection and geologic
foundation mapping are available to work onsite. Coordinate the schedule
for foundation excavation and preliminary cleanup with the CO to ensure
that the cleanup, inspection, and mapping proceed in an orderly manner.

B. Nationwide Permits
1. Aids to Navigation. The placement of aids to navigation and regulatory markers which
are approved by and installed in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Coast Guard (see
33 CFR, chapter I, subchapter C, part 66). (Section 10)
2. Structures in Artificial Canals. Structures constructed in artificial canals within
principally residential developments where the connection of the canal to a navigable water of
the United States has been previously authorized (see 33 CFR 322.5(g)). (Section 10)
3. Maintenance. (a) The repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of any previously
authorized, currently serviceable structure, or fill, or of any currently serviceable structure or fill
authorized by 33 CFR 330.3, provided that the structure or fill is not to be put to uses differing
from those uses specified or contemplated for it in the original permit or the most recently
authorized modification. Minor deviations in the structure's configuration or filled area,
including those due to changes in materials, construction techniques, requirements of other
regulatory agencies, or current construction codes or safety standards that are necessary to make
the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement are authorized. Any stream channel modification is
limited to the minimum necessary for the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of the structure or
fill; such modifications, including the removal of material from the stream channel, must be
immediately adjacent to the project or within the boundaries of the structure or fill. This NWP
also authorizes the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of those structures or fills destroyed or
damaged by storms, floods, fire or other discrete events, provided the repair, rehabilitation, or
replacement is commenced, or is under contract to commence, within two years of the date of
their destruction or damage. In cases of catastrophic events, such as hurricanes or tornadoes, this
two-year limit may be waived by the district engineer, provided the permittee can demonstrate
funding, contract, or other similar delays.
(b) This NWP also authorizes the removal of accumulated sediments and debris in the
vicinity of existing structures (e.g., bridges, culverted road crossings, water intake structures,
etc.) and/or the placement of new or additional riprap to protect the structure. The removal of
sediment is limited to the minimum necessary to restore the waterway in the vicinity of the
structure to the approximate dimensions that existed when the structure was built, but cannot
extend farther than 200 feet in any direction from the structure. This 200 foot limit does not
apply to maintenance dredging to remove accumulated sediments blocking or restricting outfall
and intake structures or to maintenance dredging to remove accumulated sediments from canals
associated with outfall and intake structures. All dredged or excavated materials must be
deposited and retained in an area that has no waters of the United States unless otherwise
specifically approved by the district engineer under separate authorization. The placement of
new or additional riprap must be the minimum necessary to protect the structure or to ensure the
safety of the structure. Any bank stabilization measures not directly associated with the structure
will require a separate authorization from the district engineer.
(c) This NWP also authorizes temporary structures, fills, and work necessary to conduct
the maintenance activity. Appropriate measures must be taken to maintain normal downstream
flows and minimize flooding to the maximum extent practicable, when temporary structures,
work, and discharges, including cofferdams, are necessary for construction activities, access fills,
A5-6
5
or dewatering of construction sites. Temporary fills must consist of materials, and be placed in a
manner, that will not be eroded by expected high flows. Temporary fills must be removed in
their entirety and the affected areas returned to pre-construction elevations. The areas affected by
temporary fills must be revegetated, as appropriate.
(d) This NWP does not authorize maintenance dredging for the primary purpose of
navigation. This NWP does not authorize beach restoration. This NWP does not authorize new
stream channelization or stream relocation projects.
Notification: For activities authorized by paragraph (b) of this NWP, the permittee must
submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity
(see general condition 31). The pre-construction notification must include information regarding
the original design capacities and configurations of the outfalls, intakes, small impoundments,
and canals. (Sections 10 and 404)
Note: This NWP authorizes the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of any previously
authorized structure or fill that does not qualify for the Clean Water Act Section 404(f)
exemption for maintenance.
4. Fish and Wildlife Harvesting, Enhancement, and Attraction Devices and Activities.
Fish and wildlife harvesting devices and activities such as pound nets, crab traps, crab dredging,
eel pots, lobster traps, duck blinds, and clam and oyster digging, fish aggregating devices, and
small fish attraction devices such as open water fish concentrators (sea kites, etc.). This NWP
does not authorize artificial reefs or impoundments and semi-impoundments of waters of the
United States for the culture or holding of motile species such as lobster, or the use of covered
oyster trays or clam racks. (Sections 10 and 404)
5. Scientific Measurement Devices. Devices, whose purpose is to measure and record
scientific data, such as staff gages, tide and current gages, meteorological stations, water
recording and biological observation devices, water quality testing and improvement devices,
and similar structures. Small weirs and flumes constructed primarily to record water quantity and
velocity are also authorized provided the discharge is limited to 25 cubic yards. Upon
completion of the use of the device to measure and record scientific data, the measuring device
and any other structures or fills associated with that device (e.g., foundations, anchors, buoys,
lines, etc.) must be removed to the maximum extent practicable and the site restored to preconstruction elevations. (Sections 10 and 404)
6. Survey Activities. Survey activities, such as core sampling, seismic exploratory
operations, plugging of seismic shot holes and other exploratory-type bore holes, exploratory
trenching, soil surveys, sampling, sample plots or transects for wetland delineations, and historic
resources surveys. For the purposes of this NWP, the term “exploratory trenching” means
mechanical land clearing of the upper soil profile to expose bedrock or substrate, for the purpose
of mapping or sampling the exposed material. The area in which the exploratory trench is dug
must be restored to its pre-construction elevation upon completion of the work and must not
drain a water of the United States. In wetlands, the top 6 to 12 inches of the trench should
normally be backfilled with topsoil from the trench. This NWP authorizes the construction of
temporary pads, provided the discharge does not exceed 1/10-acre in waters of the U.S.
Discharges and structures associated with the recovery of historic resources are not authorized by
this NWP. Drilling and the discharge of excavated material from test wells for oil and gas
A5-7
6
exploration are not authorized by this NWP; the plugging of such wells is authorized. Fill placed
for roads and other similar activities is not authorized by this NWP. The NWP does not authorize
any permanent structures. The discharge of drilling mud and cuttings may require a permit under
Section 402 of the Clean Water Act. (Sections 10 and 404)
7. Outfall Structures and Associated Intake Structures. Activities related to the
construction or modification of outfall structures and associated intake structures, where the
effluent from the outfall is authorized, conditionally authorized, or specifically exempted by, or
otherwise in compliance with regulations issued under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System Program (Section 402 of the Clean Water Act). The construction of intake
structures is not authorized by this NWP, unless they are directly associated with an authorized
outfall structure.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity. (See general condition 31.) (Sections 10 and 404)
8. Oil and Gas Structures on the Outer Continental Shelf. Structures for the exploration,
production, and transportation of oil, gas, and minerals on the outer continental shelf within areas
leased for such purposes by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management. Such structures shall not be placed within the limits of any designated shipping
safety fairway or traffic separation scheme, except temporary anchors that comply with the
fairway regulations in 33 CFR 322.5(l). The district engineer will review such proposals to
ensure compliance with the provisions of the fairway regulations in 33 CFR 322.5(l). Any Corps
review under this NWP will be limited to the effects on navigation and national security in
accordance with 33 CFR 322.5(f), as well as 33 CFR 322.5(l) and 33 CFR part 334. Such
structures will not be placed in established danger zones or restricted areas as designated in 33
CFR part 334, nor will such structures be permitted in EPA or Corps designated dredged material
disposal areas.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity. (See general condition 31.) (Section 10)
9. Structures in Fleeting and Anchorage Areas. Structures, buoys, floats and other devices
placed within anchorage or fleeting areas to facilitate moorage of vessels where the U.S. Coast
Guard has established such areas for that purpose. (Section 10)
10. Mooring Buoys. Non-commercial, single-boat, mooring buoys. (Section 10)
11. Temporary Recreational Structures. Temporary buoys, markers, small floating docks,
and similar structures placed for recreational use during specific events such as water skiing
competitions and boat races or seasonal use, provided that such structures are removed within 30
days after use has been discontinued. At Corps of Engineers reservoirs, the reservoir manager
must approve each buoy or marker individually. (Section 10)
12. Utility Line Activities. Activities required for the construction, maintenance, repair,
and removal of utility lines and associated facilities in waters of the United States, provided the
activity does not result in the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of waters of the United States for each
single and complete project.
A5-8

Utility lines: This NWP authorizes the construction, maintenance, or repair of utility
lines, including outfall and intake structures, and the associated excavation, backfill, or bedding
for the utility lines, in all waters of the United States, provided there is no change in preconstruction contours. A “utility line” is defined as any pipe or pipeline for the transportation of
any gaseous, liquid, liquescent, or slurry substance, for any purpose, and any cable, line, or wire
for the transmission for any purpose of electrical energy, telephone, and telegraph messages, and
radio and television communication. The term “utility line” does not include activities that drain
a water of the United States, such as drainage tile or french drains, but it does apply to pipes
conveying drainage from another area.
Material resulting from trench excavation may be temporarily sidecast into waters of the
United States for no more than three months, provided the material is not placed in such a
manner that it is dispersed by currents or other forces. The district engineer may extend the
period of temporary side casting for no more than a total of 180 days, where appropriate. In
wetlands, the top 6 to 12 inches of the trench should normally be backfilled with topsoil from the
trench. The trench cannot be constructed or backfilled in such a manner as to drain waters of the
United States (e.g., backfilling with extensive gravel layers, creating a french drain effect). Any
exposed slopes and stream banks must be stabilized immediately upon completion of the utility
line crossing of each waterbody.
Utility line substations: This NWP authorizes the construction, maintenance, or
expansion of substation facilities associated with a power line or utility line in non-tidal waters
of the United States, provided the activity, in combination with all other activities included in
one single and complete project, does not result in the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of waters of
the United States. This NWP does not authorize discharges into non-tidal wetlands adjacent to
tidal waters of the United States to construct, maintain, or expand substation facilities.
Foundations for overhead utility line towers, poles, and anchors: This NWP authorizes
the construction or maintenance of foundations for overhead utility line towers, poles, and
anchors in all waters of the United States, provided the foundations are the minimum size
necessary and separate footings for each tower leg (rather than a larger single pad) are used
where feasible.
Access roads: This NWP authorizes the construction of access roads for the construction
and maintenance of utility lines, including overhead power lines and utility line substations, in
non-tidal waters of the United States, provided the activity, in combination with all other
activities included in one single and complete project, does not cause the loss of greater than 1/2-
acre of non-tidal waters of the United States. This NWP does not authorize discharges into nontidal wetlands adjacent to tidal waters for access roads. Access roads must be the minimum width
necessary (see Note 2, below). Access roads must be constructed so that the length of the road
minimizes any adverse effects on waters of the United States and must be as near as possible to
pre-construction contours and elevations (e.g., at grade corduroy roads or geotextile/gravel
roads). Access roads constructed above pre-construction contours and elevations in waters of the
United States must be properly bridged or culverted to maintain surface flows.
This NWP may authorize utility lines in or affecting navigable waters of the United
States even if there is no associated discharge of dredged or fill material (See 33 CFR Part 322).
Overhead utility lines constructed over section 10 waters and utility lines that are routed in or
under section 10 waters without a discharge of dredged or fill material require a section 10
permit.
A5-9
8
This NWP also authorizes temporary structures, fills, and work necessary to conduct the
utility line activity. Appropriate measures must be taken to maintain normal downstream flows
and minimize flooding to the maximum extent practicable, when temporary structures, work, and
discharges, including cofferdams, are necessary for construction activities, access fills, or
dewatering of construction sites. Temporary fills must consist of materials, and be placed in a
manner, that will not be eroded by expected high flows. Temporary fills must be removed in
their entirety and the affected areas returned to pre-construction elevations. The areas affected by
temporary fills must be revegetated, as appropriate.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity if any of the following criteria are met: (1) the activity
involves mechanized land clearing in a forested wetland for the utility line right-of-way; (2) a
section 10 permit is required; (3) the utility line in waters of the United States, excluding
overhead lines, exceeds 500 feet; (4) the utility line is placed within a jurisdictional area (i.e.,
water of the United States), and it runs parallel to or along a stream bed that is within that
jurisdictional area; (5) discharges that result in the loss of greater than 1/10-acre of waters of the
United States; (6) permanent access roads are constructed above grade in waters of the United
States for a distance of more than 500 feet; or (7) permanent access roads are constructed in
waters of the United States with impervious materials. (See general condition 31.) (Sections 10
and 404)
Note 1: Where the proposed utility line is constructed or installed in navigable waters of
the United States (i.e., section 10 waters) within the coastal United States, the Great Lakes, and
United States territories, copies of the pre-construction notification and NWP verification will be
sent by the Corps to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National
Ocean Service (NOS), for charting the utility line to protect navigation.
Note 2: Access roads used for both construction and maintenance may be authorized,
provided they meet the terms and conditions of this NWP. Access roads used solely for
construction of the utility line must be removed upon completion of the work, in accordance with
the requirements for temporary fills.
Note 3: Pipes or pipelines used to transport gaseous, liquid, liquescent, or slurry
substances over navigable waters of the United States are considered to be bridges, not utility
lines, and may require a permit from the U.S. Coast Guard pursuant to Section 9 of the Rivers
and Harbors Act of 1899. However, any discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the
United States associated with such pipelines will require a section 404 permit (see NWP 15).
Note 4: For overhead utility lines authorized by this NWP, a copy of the PCN and NWP
verification will be provided to the Department of Defense Siting Clearinghouse, which will
evaluate potential effects on military activities.
13. Bank Stabilization. Bank stabilization activities necessary for erosion prevention,
provided the activity meets all of the following criteria:
(a) No material is placed in excess of the minimum needed for erosion protection;
(b) The activity is no more than 500 feet in length along the bank, unless the district
engineer waives this criterion by making a written determination concluding that the discharge
will result in minimal adverse effects;
(c) The activity will not exceed an average of one cubic yard per running foot placed
along the bank below the plane of the ordinary high water mark or the high tide line, unless the
A5-10
9
district engineer waives this criterion by making a written determination concluding that the
discharge will result in minimal adverse effects;
(d) The activity does not involve discharges of dredged or fill material into special
aquatic sites, unless the district engineer waives this criterion by making a written determination
concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse effects;
(e) No material is of a type, or is placed in any location, or in any manner, that will
impair surface water flow into or out of any waters of the United States;
(f) No material is placed in a manner that will be eroded by normal or expected high
flows (properly anchored trees and treetops may be used in low energy areas); and,
(g) The activity is not a stream channelization activity.
This NWP also authorizes temporary structures, fills, and work necessary to construct the
bank stabilization activity. Appropriate measures must be taken to maintain normal downstream
flows and minimize flooding to the maximum extent practicable, when temporary structures,
work, and discharges, including cofferdams, are necessary for construction activities, access fills,
or dewatering of construction sites. Temporary fills must consist of materials, and be placed in a
manner, that will not be eroded by expected high flows. Temporary fills must be removed in
their entirety and the affected areas returned to pre-construction elevations. The areas affected by
temporary fills must be revegetated, as appropriate.
Invasive plant species shall not be used for bioengineering or vegetative bank
stabilization.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity if the bank stabilization activity: (1) involves
discharges into special aquatic sites; or (2) is in excess of 500 feet in length; or (3) will involve
the discharge of greater than an average of one cubic yard per running foot along the bank below
the plane of the ordinary high water mark or the high tide line. (See general condition 31.)
(Sections 10 and 404)
14. Linear Transportation Projects. Activities required for the construction, expansion,
modification, or improvement of linear transportation projects (e.g., roads, highways, railways,
trails, airport runways, and taxiways) in waters of the United States. For linear transportation
projects in non-tidal waters, the discharge cannot cause the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of waters
of the United States. For linear transportation projects in tidal waters, the discharge cannot cause
the loss of greater than 1/3-acre of waters of the United States. Any stream channel modification,
including bank stabilization, is limited to the minimum necessary to construct or protect the
linear transportation project; such modifications must be in the immediate vicinity of the project.
This NWP also authorizes temporary structures, fills, and work necessary to construct the
linear transportation project. Appropriate measures must be taken to maintain normal
downstream flows and minimize flooding to the maximum extent practicable, when temporary
structures, work, and discharges, including cofferdams, are necessary for construction activities,
access fills, or dewatering of construction sites. Temporary fills must consist of materials, and be
placed in a manner, that will not be eroded by expected high flows. Temporary fills must be
removed in their entirety and the affected areas returned to pre-construction elevations. The areas
affected by temporary fills must be revegetated, as appropriate.
This NWP cannot be used to authorize non-linear features commonly associated with
transportation projects, such as vehicle maintenance or storage buildings, parking lots, train
stations, or aircraft hangars.
A5-11
10
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity if: (1) the loss of waters of the United States exceeds
1/10-acre; or (2) there is a discharge in a special aquatic site, including wetlands. (See general
condition 31.) (Sections 10 and 404)
Note: Some discharges for the construction of farm roads or forest roads, or temporary
roads for moving mining equipment, may qualify for an exemption under Section 404(f) of the
Clean Water Act (see 33 CFR 323.4).
15. U.S. Coast Guard Approved Bridges. Discharges of dredged or fill material incidental
to the construction of a bridge across navigable waters of the United States, including
cofferdams, abutments, foundation seals, piers, and temporary construction and access fills,
provided the construction of the bridge structure has been authorized by the U.S. Coast Guard
under Section 9 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and other applicable laws. Causeways
and approach fills are not included in this NWP and will require a separate section 404 permit.
(Section 404)
16. Return Water From Upland Contained Disposal Areas. Return water from an upland
contained dredged material disposal area. The return water from a contained disposal area is
administratively defined as a discharge of dredged material by 33 CFR 323.2(d), even though the
disposal itself occurs in an area that has no waters of the United States and does not require a
section 404 permit. This NWP satisfies the technical requirement for a section 404 permit for the
return water where the quality of the return water is controlled by the state through the section
401 certification procedures. The dredging activity may require a section 404 permit (33 CFR
323.2(d)), and will require a section 10 permit if located in navigable waters of the United States.
(Section 404)
17. Hydropower Projects. Discharges of dredged or fill material associated with
hydropower projects having: (a) Less than 5000 kW of total generating capacity at existing
reservoirs, where the project, including the fill, is licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) under the Federal Power Act of 1920, as amended; or (b) a licensing
exemption granted by the FERC pursuant to Section 408 of the Energy Security Act of 1980 (16
U.S.C. 2705 and 2708) and Section 30 of the Federal Power Act, as amended.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity. (See general condition 31.) (Section 404)
18. Minor Discharges. Minor discharges of dredged or fill material into all waters of the
United States, provided the activity meets all of the following criteria:
(a) The quantity of discharged material and the volume of area excavated do not exceed
25 cubic yards below the plane of the ordinary high water mark or the high tide line;
(b) The discharge will not cause the loss of more than 1/10-acre of waters of the United
States; and
(c) The discharge is not placed for the purpose of a stream diversion.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity if: (1) The discharge or the volume of area excavated
exceeds 10 cubic yards below the plane of the ordinary high water mark or the high tide line, or
A5-12
11
(2) the discharge is in a special aquatic site, including wetlands. (See general condition 31.)
(Sections 10 and 404)
19. Minor Dredging. Dredging of no more than 25 cubic yards below the plane of the
ordinary high water mark or the mean high water mark from navigable waters of the United
States (i.e., section 10 waters). This NWP does not authorize the dredging or degradation through
siltation of coral reefs, sites that support submerged aquatic vegetation (including sites where
submerged aquatic vegetation is documented to exist but may not be present in a given year),
anadromous fish spawning areas, or wetlands, or the connection of canals or other artificial
waterways to navigable waters of the United States (see 33 CFR 322.5(g)). (Sections 10 and 404)
20. Response Operations for Oil and Hazardous Substances. Activities conducted in
response to a discharge or release of oil and hazardous substances that are subject to the National
Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (40 CFR part 300) including
containment, cleanup, and mitigation efforts, provided that the activities are done under either:
(1) the Spill Control and Countermeasure Plan required by 40 CFR 112.3; (2) the direction or
oversight of the federal on-scene coordinator designated by 40 CFR part 300; or (3) any
approved existing state, regional or local contingency plan provided that the Regional Response
Team (if one exists in the area) concurs with the proposed response efforts. This NWP also
authorizes activities required for the cleanup of oil releases in waters of the United States from
electrical equipment that are governed by EPA’s polychlorinated biphenyl spill response
regulations at 40 CFR part 761. This NWP also authorizes the use of temporary structures and
fills in waters of the U.S. for spill response training exercises. (Sections 10 and 404)
21. Surface Coal Mining Activities. Discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of
the United States associated with surface coal mining and reclamation operations.
(a) Previously Authorized Surface Coal Mining Activities. Surface coal mining activities
that were previously authorized by the NWP 21 issued on March 12, 2007 (see 72 FR 11092),
are authorized by this NWP, provided the following criteria are met:
(1) The activities are already authorized, or are currently being processed by states with
approved programs under Title V of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 or
as part of an integrated permit processing procedure by the Department of Interior, Office of
Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement;
(2) The permittee must submit a letter to the district engineer requesting re-verification of
the NWP 21 authorization. The letter must describe any changes from the previous NWP 21
verification. The letter must be submitted to the district engineer by February 1, 2013;
(3) The loss of waters of the United States is not greater than the loss of waters of the
United States previously verified by the district engineer under the NWP 21 issued on March 12,
2007 (i.e., there are no proposed expansions of surface coal mining activities in waters of the
United States);
(4) The district engineer provides written verification that those activities will result in
minimal individual and cumulative adverse effects and are authorized by NWP 21, including
currently applicable regional conditions and any activity-specific conditions added to the NWP
authorization by the district engineer, such as compensatory mitigation requirements; and
(5) If the permittee does not receive a written verification from the district engineer prior
to March 18, 2013, the permittee must cease all activities until such verification is received. The
A5-13
12
district engineer may extend the February 1, 2013, deadline by so notifying the permittee in
writing, but the permittee must still cease all activities if he or she has not received written
verification from the Corps by March 18, 2013, until such verification is received.
(b) Other Surface Coal Mining Activities. Surface coal mining activities that were not
previously authorized by the NWP 21 issued on March 12, 2007, are authorized by this NWP,
provided the following criteria are met:
(1) The activities are already authorized, or are currently being processed by states with
approved programs under Title V of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 or
as part of an integrated permit processing procedure by the Department of Interior, Office of
Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement;
(2) The discharge must not cause the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of non-tidal waters of
the United States, including the loss of no more than 300 linear feet of stream bed, unless for
intermittent and ephemeral stream beds the district engineer waives the 300 linear foot limit by
making a written determination concluding that the discharge will result in minimal individual
and cumulative adverse effects. This NWP does not authorize discharges into tidal waters or
non-tidal wetlands adjacent to tidal waters; and
(3) The discharge is not associated with the construction of valley fills. A “valley fill” is
a fill structure that is typically constructed within valleys associated with steep, mountainous
terrain, associated with surface coal mining activities.
 Notification: For activities under paragraph (b) of this NWP, the permittee must submit a
pre-construction notification to the district engineer and receive written authorization prior to
commencing the activity. (See general condition 31.) (Sections 10 and 404)
22. Removal of Vessels. Temporary structures or minor discharges of dredged or fill
material required for the removal of wrecked, abandoned, or disabled vessels, or the removal of
man-made obstructions to navigation. This NWP does not authorize maintenance dredging, shoal
removal, or riverbank snagging.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity if: (1) The vessel is listed or eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places; or (2) the activity is conducted in a special aquatic site,
including coral reefs and wetlands. (See general condition 31.) If condition 1 above is triggered,
the permittee cannot commence the activity until informed by the district engineer that
compliance with the “Historic Properties” general condition is completed. (Sections 10 and 404)
Note 1: If a removed vessel is disposed of in waters of the United States, a permit from
the U.S. EPA may be required (see 40 CFR 229.3). If a Department of the Army permit is
required for vessel disposal in waters of the United States, separate authorization will be
required.
Note 2: Compliance with general condition 18, Endangered Species, and general
condition 20, Historic Properties, is required for all NWPs. The concern with historic properties
is emphasized in the notification requirements for this NWP because of the likelihood that
submerged vessels may be historic properties.
23. Approved Categorical Exclusions. Activities undertaken, assisted, authorized,
regulated, funded, or financed, in whole or in part, by another Federal agency or department
where:
A5-14
13
(a) That agency or department has determined, pursuant to the Council on Environmental
Quality's implementing regulations for the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR part
1500 et seq.), that the activity is categorically excluded from environmental documentation,
because it is included within a category of actions which neither individually nor cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment; and
(b) The Office of the Chief of Engineers (Attn: CECW-CO) has concurred with that
agency’s or department’s determination that the activity is categorically excluded and approved
the activity for authorization under NWP 23.
The Office of the Chief of Engineers may require additional conditions, including preconstruction notification, for authorization of an agency’s categorical exclusions under this
NWP.
Notification: Certain categorical exclusions approved for authorization under this NWP
require the permittee to submit a pre-construction notification to the district engineer prior to
commencing the activity (see general condition 31). The activities that require pre-construction
notification are listed in the appropriate Regulatory Guidance Letters. (Sections 10 and 404)
Note: The agency or department may submit an application for an activity believed to be
categorically excluded to the Office of the Chief of Engineers (Attn: CECW-CO). Prior to
approval for authorization under this NWP of any agency's activity, the Office of the Chief of
Engineers will solicit public comment. As of the date of issuance of this NWP, agencies with
approved categorical exclusions are the: Bureau of Reclamation, Federal Highway
Administration, and U.S. Coast Guard. Activities approved for authorization under this NWP as
of the date of this notice are found in Corps Regulatory Guidance Letter 05-07, which is
available at:
http://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/RegulatoryProgramandPermits/GuidanceLetter
s.aspx . Any future approved categorical exclusions will be announced in Regulatory Guidance
Letters and posted on this same web site.
24. Indian Tribe or State Administered Section 404 Programs. Any activity permitted by
a state or Indian Tribe administering its own section 404 permit program pursuant to 33 U.S.C.
1344(g)-(l) is permitted pursuant to Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. (Section
10)
Note 1: As of the date of the promulgation of this NWP, only New Jersey and Michigan
administer their own section 404 permit programs.
Note 2: Those activities that do not involve an Indian Tribe or State section 404 permit
are not included in this NWP, but certain structures will be exempted by Section 154 of Pub. L.
94-587, 90 Stat. 2917 (33 U.S.C. 591) (see 33 CFR 322.4(b)).
25. Structural Discharges. Discharges of material such as concrete, sand, rock, etc., into
tightly sealed forms or cells where the material will be used as a structural member for standard
pile supported structures, such as bridges, transmission line footings, and walkways, or for
general navigation, such as mooring cells, including the excavation of bottom material from
within the form prior to the discharge of concrete, sand, rock, etc. This NWP does not authorize
filled structural members that would support buildings, building pads, homes, house pads,
parking areas, storage areas and other such structures. The structure itself may require a separate
section 10 permit if located in navigable waters of the United States. (Section 404)
A5-15
14
26. [Reserved]
27. Aquatic Habitat Restoration, Establishment, and Enhancement Activities. Activities
in waters of the United States associated with the restoration, enhancement, and establishment of
tidal and non-tidal wetlands and riparian areas, the restoration and enhancement of non-tidal
streams and other non-tidal open waters, and the rehabilitation or enhancement of tidal streams,
tidal wetlands, and tidal open waters, provided those activities result in net increases in aquatic
resource functions and services.
To the extent that a Corps permit is required, activities authorized by this NWP include,
but are not limited to: the removal of accumulated sediments; the installation, removal, and
maintenance of small water control structures, dikes, and berms, as well as discharges of dredged
or fill material to restore appropriate stream channel configurations after small water control
structures, dikes, and berms, are removed; the installation of current deflectors; the enhancement,
restoration, or establishment of riffle and pool stream structure; the placement of in-stream
habitat structures; modifications of the stream bed and/or banks to restore or establish stream
meanders; the backfilling of artificial channels; the removal of existing drainage structures, such
as drain tiles, and the filling, blocking, or reshaping of drainage ditches to restore wetland
hydrology; the installation of structures or fills necessary to establish or re-establish wetland or
stream hydrology; the construction of small nesting islands; the construction of open water areas;
the construction of oyster habitat over unvegetated bottom in tidal waters; shellfish seeding;
activities needed to reestablish vegetation, including plowing or discing for seed bed preparation
and the planting of appropriate wetland species; re-establishment of submerged aquatic
vegetation in areas where those plant communities previously existed; re-establishment of tidal
wetlands in tidal waters where those wetlands previously existed; mechanized land clearing to
remove non-native invasive, exotic, or nuisance vegetation; and other related activities. Only
native plant species should be planted at the site.
This NWP authorizes the relocation of non-tidal waters, including non-tidal wetlands and
streams, on the project site provided there are net increases in aquatic resource functions and
services.
Except for the relocation of non-tidal waters on the project site, this NWP does not
authorize the conversion of a stream or natural wetlands to another aquatic habitat type (e.g.,
stream to wetland or vice versa) or uplands. Changes in wetland plant communities that occur
when wetland hydrology is more fully restored during wetland rehabilitation activities are not
considered a conversion to another aquatic habitat type. This NWP does not authorize stream
channelization. This NWP does not authorize the relocation of tidal waters or the conversion of
tidal waters, including tidal wetlands, to other aquatic uses, such as the conversion of tidal
wetlands into open water impoundments.
Compensatory mitigation is not required for activities authorized by this NWP since these
activities must result in net increases in aquatic resource functions and services.
Reversion. For enhancement, restoration, and establishment activities conducted: (1) In
accordance with the terms and conditions of a binding stream or wetland enhancement or
restoration agreement, or a wetland establishment agreement, between the landowner and the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the
Farm Service Agency (FSA), the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the National Ocean
Service (NOS), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), or their designated state cooperating agencies; (2) as
voluntary wetland restoration, enhancement, and establishment actions documented by the
A5-16
15
NRCS or USDA Technical Service Provider pursuant to NRCS Field Office Technical Guide
standards; or (3) on reclaimed surface coal mine lands, in accordance with a Surface Mining
Control and Reclamation Act permit issued by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and
Enforcement (OSMRE) or the applicable state agency, this NWP also authorizes any future
discharge of dredged or fill material associated with the reversion of the area to its documented
prior condition and use (i.e., prior to the restoration, enhancement, or establishment activities).
The reversion must occur within five years after expiration of a limited term wetland restoration
or establishment agreement or permit, and is authorized in these circumstances even if the
discharge occurs after this NWP expires. The five-year reversion limit does not apply to
agreements without time limits reached between the landowner and the FWS, NRCS, FSA,
NMFS, NOS, USFS, or an appropriate state cooperating agency. This NWP also authorizes
discharges of dredged or fill material in waters of the United States for the reversion of wetlands
that were restored, enhanced, or established on prior-converted cropland or on uplands, in
accordance with a binding agreement between the landowner and NRCS, FSA, FWS, or their
designated state cooperating agencies (even though the restoration, enhancement, or
establishment activity did not require a section 404 permit). The prior condition will be
documented in the original agreement or permit, and the determination of return to prior
conditions will be made by the Federal agency or appropriate state agency executing the
agreement or permit. Before conducting any reversion activity the permittee or the appropriate
Federal or state agency must notify the district engineer and include the documentation of the
prior condition. Once an area has reverted to its prior physical condition, it will be subject to
whatever the Corps Regulatory requirements are applicable to that type of land at the time. The
requirement that the activity results in a net increase in aquatic resource functions and services
does not apply to reversion activities meeting the above conditions. Except for the activities
described above, this NWP does not authorize any future discharge of dredged or fill material
associated with the reversion of the area to its prior condition. In such cases a separate permit
would be required for any reversion.
Reporting. For those activities that do not require pre-construction notification, the
permittee must submit to the district engineer a copy of: (1) The binding stream enhancement or
restoration agreement or wetland enhancement, restoration, or establishment agreement, or a
project description, including project plans and location map; (2) the NRCS or USDA Technical
Service Provider documentation for the voluntary stream enhancement or restoration action or
wetland restoration, enhancement, or establishment action; or (3) the SMCRA permit issued by
OSMRE or the applicable state agency. The report must also include information on baseline
ecological conditions on the project site, such as a delineation of wetlands, streams, and/or other
aquatic habitats. These documents must be submitted to the district engineer at least 30 days
prior to commencing activities in waters of the United States authorized by this NWP.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing any activity (see general condition 31), except for the following
activities:
(1) Activities conducted on non-Federal public lands and private lands, in accordance
with the terms and conditions of a binding stream enhancement or restoration agreement or
wetland enhancement, restoration, or establishment agreement between the landowner and the
U.S. FWS, NRCS, FSA, NMFS, NOS, USFS or their designated state cooperating agencies;
A5-17
16
(2) Voluntary stream or wetland restoration or enhancement action, or wetland
establishment action, documented by the NRCS or USDA Technical Service Provider pursuant
to NRCS Field Office Technical Guide standards; or
(3) The reclamation of surface coal mine lands, in accordance with an SMCRA permit
issued by the OSMRE or the applicable state agency.
However, the permittee must submit a copy of the appropriate documentation to the
district engineer to fulfill the reporting requirement. (Sections 10 and 404)
Note: This NWP can be used to authorize compensatory mitigation projects, including
mitigation banks and in-lieu fee projects. However, this NWP does not authorize the reversion of
an area used for a compensatory mitigation project to its prior condition, since compensatory
mitigation is generally intended to be permanent.
28. Modifications of Existing Marinas. Reconfiguration of existing docking facilities
within an authorized marina area. No dredging, additional slips, dock spaces, or expansion of any
kind within waters of the United States is authorized by this NWP. (Section 10)
29. Residential Developments. Discharges of dredged or fill material into non-tidal
waters of the United States for the construction or expansion of a single residence, a multiple
unit residential development, or a residential subdivision. This NWP authorizes the construction
of building foundations and building pads and attendant features that are necessary for the use of
the residence or residential development. Attendant features may include but are not limited to
roads, parking lots, garages, yards, utility lines, storm water management facilities, septic fields,
and recreation facilities such as playgrounds, playing fields, and golf courses (provided the golf
course is an integral part of the residential development).
The discharge must not cause the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of non-tidal waters of the
United States, including the loss of no more than 300 linear feet of stream bed, unless for
intermittent and ephemeral stream beds the district engineer waives the 300 linear foot limit by
making a written determination concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse
effects. This NWP does not authorize discharges into non-tidal wetlands adjacent to tidal waters.
Subdivisions: For residential subdivisions, the aggregate total loss of waters of United
States authorized by this NWP cannot exceed 1/2-acre. This includes any loss of waters of the
United States associated with development of individual subdivision lots.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity. (See general condition 31.) (Sections 10 and 404)
30. Moist Soil Management for Wildlife. Discharges of dredged or fill material into nontidal waters of the United States and maintenance activities that are associated with moist soil
management for wildlife for the purpose of continuing ongoing, site-specific, wildlife
management activities where soil manipulation is used to manage habitat and feeding areas for
wildlife. Such activities include, but are not limited to, plowing or discing to impede succession,
preparing seed beds, or establishing fire breaks. Sufficient riparian areas must be maintained
adjacent to all open water bodies, including streams, to preclude water quality degradation due to
erosion and sedimentation. This NWP does not authorize the construction of new dikes, roads,
water control structures, or similar features associated with the management areas. The activity
must not result in a net loss of aquatic resource functions and services. This NWP does not
A5-18
17
authorize the conversion of wetlands to uplands, impoundments, or other open water bodies.
(Section 404)
Note: The repair, maintenance, or replacement of existing water control structures or the
repair or maintenance of dikes may be authorized by NWP 3. Some such activities may qualify
for an exemption under Section 404(f) of the Clean Water Act (see 33 CFR 323.4).
31. Maintenance of Existing Flood Control Facilities. Discharges of dredged or fill
material resulting from activities associated with the maintenance of existing flood control
facilities, including debris basins, retention/detention basins, levees, and channels that: (i) were
previously authorized by the Corps by individual permit, general permit, or 33 CFR 330.3, or did
not require a permit at the time they were constructed, or (ii) were constructed by the Corps and
transferred to a non-Federal sponsor for operation and maintenance. Activities authorized by this
NWP are limited to those resulting from maintenance activities that are conducted within the
“maintenance baseline,” as described in the definition below. Discharges of dredged or fill
materials associated with maintenance activities in flood control facilities in any watercourse that
have previously been determined to be within the maintenance baseline are authorized under this
NWP. To the extent that a Corps permit is required, this NWP authorizes the removal of
vegetation from levees associated with the flood control project. This NWP does not authorize
the removal of sediment and associated vegetation from natural water courses except when these
activities have been included in the maintenance baseline. All dredged material must be placed in
an area that has no waters of the United States or a separately authorized disposal site in waters
of the United States, and proper siltation controls must be used.
Maintenance Baseline: The maintenance baseline is a description of the physical
characteristics (e.g., depth, width, length, location, configuration, or design flood capacity, etc.)
of a flood control project within which maintenance activities are normally authorized by NWP
31, subject to any case-specific conditions required by the district engineer. The district engineer
will approve the maintenance baseline based on the approved or constructed capacity of the flood
control facility, whichever is smaller, including any areas where there are no constructed
channels but which are part of the facility. The prospective permittee will provide documentation
of the physical characteristics of the flood control facility (which will normally consist of as-built
or approved drawings) and documentation of the approved and constructed design capacities of
the flood control facility. If no evidence of the constructed capacity exists, the approved capacity
will be used. The documentation will also include best management practices to ensure that the
impacts to the aquatic environment are minimal, especially in maintenance areas where there are
no constructed channels. (The Corps may request maintenance records in areas where there has
not been recent maintenance.) Revocation or modification of the final determination of the
maintenance baseline can only be done in accordance with 33 CFR 330.5. Except in emergencies
as described below, this NWP cannot be used until the district engineer approves the
maintenance baseline and determines the need for mitigation and any regional or activity-specific
conditions. Once determined, the maintenance baseline will remain valid for any subsequent
reissuance of this NWP. This NWP does not authorize maintenance of a flood control facility
that has been abandoned. A flood control facility will be considered abandoned if it has operated
at a significantly reduced capacity without needed maintenance being accomplished in a timely
manner.
Mitigation: The district engineer will determine any required mitigation one-time only for
impacts associated with maintenance work at the same time that the maintenance baseline is
A5-19
18
approved. Such one-time mitigation will be required when necessary to ensure that adverse
environmental impacts are no more than minimal, both individually and cumulatively. Such
mitigation will only be required once for any specific reach of a flood control project. However,
if one-time mitigation is required for impacts associated with maintenance activities, the district
engineer will not delay needed maintenance, provided the district engineer and the permittee
establish a schedule for identification, approval, development, construction and completion of
any such required mitigation. Once the one-time mitigation described above has been completed,
or a determination made that mitigation is not required, no further mitigation will be required for
maintenance activities within the maintenance baseline. In determining appropriate mitigation,
the district engineer will give special consideration to natural water courses that have been
included in the maintenance baseline and require compensatory mitigation and/or best
management practices as appropriate.
Emergency Situations: In emergency situations, this NWP may be used to authorize
maintenance activities in flood control facilities for which no maintenance baseline has been
approved. Emergency situations are those which would result in an unacceptable hazard to life, a
significant loss of property, or an immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship if
action is not taken before a maintenance baseline can be approved. In such situations, the
determination of mitigation requirements, if any, may be deferred until the emergency has been
resolved. Once the emergency has ended, a maintenance baseline must be established
expeditiously, and mitigation, including mitigation for maintenance conducted during the
emergency, must be required as appropriate.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer before any maintenance work is conducted (see general condition 31). The preconstruction notification may be for activity-specific maintenance or for maintenance of the
entire flood control facility by submitting a five-year (or less) maintenance plan. The preconstruction notification must include a description of the maintenance baseline and the dredged
material disposal site. (Sections 10 and 404)
32. Completed Enforcement Actions. Any structure, work, or discharge of dredged or fill
material remaining in place or undertaken for mitigation, restoration, or environmental benefit in
compliance with either:
(i) The terms of a final written Corps non-judicial settlement agreement resolving a
violation of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and/or Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act
of 1899; or the terms of an EPA 309(a) order on consent resolving a violation of Section 404 of
the Clean Water Act, provided that:
(a) The unauthorized activity affected no more than 5 acres of non-tidal waters or 1 acre
of tidal waters;
(b) The settlement agreement provides for environmental benefits, to an equal or greater
degree, than the environmental detriments caused by the unauthorized activity that is authorized
by this NWP; and
(c) The district engineer issues a verification letter authorizing the activity subject to the
terms and conditions of this NWP and the settlement agreement, including a specified
completion date; or
(ii) The terms of a final Federal court decision, consent decree, or settlement agreement
resulting from an enforcement action brought by the United States under Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act and/or Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899; or
A5-20
19
(iii) The terms of a final court decision, consent decree, settlement agreement, or nonjudicial settlement agreement resulting from a natural resource damage claim brought by a
trustee or trustees for natural resources (as defined by the National Contingency Plan at 40 CFR
subpart G) under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, Section 107 of the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, Section 312 of the National Marine
Sanctuaries Act, Section 1002 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or the Park System Resource
Protection Act at 16 U.S.C. 19jj, to the extent that a Corps permit is required.
Compliance is a condition of the NWP itself. Any authorization under this NWP is
automatically revoked if the permittee does not comply with the terms of this NWP or the terms
of the court decision, consent decree, or judicial/non-judicial settlement agreement. This NWP
does not apply to any activities occurring after the date of the decision, decree, or agreement that
are not for the purpose of mitigation, restoration, or environmental benefit. Before reaching any
settlement agreement, the Corps will ensure compliance with the provisions of 33 CFR part 326
and 33 CFR 330.6(d)(2) and (e). (Sections 10 and 404)
33. Temporary Construction, Access, and Dewatering. Temporary structures, work, and
discharges, including cofferdams, necessary for construction activities or access fills or
dewatering of construction sites, provided that the associated primary activity is authorized by
the Corps of Engineers or the U.S. Coast Guard. This NWP also authorizes temporary structures,
work, and discharges, including cofferdams, necessary for construction activities not otherwise
subject to the Corps or U.S. Coast Guard permit requirements. Appropriate measures must be
taken to maintain near normal downstream flows and to minimize flooding. Fill must consist of
materials, and be placed in a manner, that will not be eroded by expected high flows. The use of
dredged material may be allowed if the district engineer determines that it will not cause more
than minimal adverse effects on aquatic resources. Following completion of construction,
temporary fill must be entirely removed to an area that has no waters of the United States,
dredged material must be returned to its original location, and the affected areas must be restored
to pre-construction elevations. The affected areas must also be revegetated, as appropriate. This
permit does not authorize the use of cofferdams to dewater wetlands or other aquatic areas to
change their use. Structures left in place after construction is completed require a separate
section 10 permit if located in navigable waters of the United States. (See 33 CFR part 322.)
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity (see general condition 31). The pre-construction
notification must include a restoration plan showing how all temporary fills and structures will
be removed and the area restored to pre-project conditions. (Sections 10 and 404)
34. Cranberry Production Activities. Discharges of dredged or fill material for dikes,
berms, pumps, water control structures or leveling of cranberry beds associated with expansion,
enhancement, or modification activities at existing cranberry production operations. The
cumulative total acreage of disturbance per cranberry production operation, including but not
limited to, filling, flooding, ditching, or clearing, must not exceed 10 acres of waters of the
United States, including wetlands. The activity must not result in a net loss of wetland acreage.
This NWP does not authorize any discharge of dredged or fill material related to other cranberry
production activities such as warehouses, processing facilities, or parking areas. For the purposes
of this NWP, the cumulative total of 10 acres will be measured over the period that this NWP is
valid.
A5-21
20
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer once during the period that this NWP is valid, and the NWP will then authorize
discharges of dredge or fill material at an existing operation for the permit term, provided the 10-
acre limit is not exceeded. (See general condition 31.) (Section 404)
35. Maintenance Dredging of Existing Basins. Excavation and removal of accumulated
sediment for maintenance of existing marina basins, access channels to marinas or boat slips, and
boat slips to previously authorized depths or controlling depths for ingress/egress, whichever is
less, provided the dredged material is deposited at an area that has no waters of the United States
site and proper siltation controls are used. (Section 10)
36. Boat Ramps. Activities required for the construction of boat ramps, provided the
activity meets all of the following criteria:
(a) The discharge into waters of the United States does not exceed 50 cubic yards of
concrete, rock, crushed stone or gravel into forms, or in the form of pre-cast concrete planks or
slabs, unless the district engineer waives the 50 cubic yard limit by making a written
determination concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse effects;
(b) The boat ramp does not exceed 20 feet in width, unless the district engineer waives
this criterion by making a written determination concluding that the discharge will result in
minimal adverse effects;
(c) The base material is crushed stone, gravel or other suitable material;
(d) The excavation is limited to the area necessary for site preparation and all excavated
material is removed to an area that has no waters of the United States; and,
(e) No material is placed in special aquatic sites, including wetlands.
The use of unsuitable material that is structurally unstable is not authorized. If dredging
in navigable waters of the United States is necessary to provide access to the boat ramp, the
dredging must be authorized by another NWP, a regional general permit, or an individual permit.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity if: (1) The discharge into waters of the United States
exceeds 50 cubic yards, or (2) the boat ramp exceeds 20 feet in width. (See general condition
31.) (Sections 10 and 404)
37. Emergency Watershed Protection and Rehabilitation. Work done by or funded by:
(a) The Natural Resources Conservation Service for a situation requiring immediate
action under its emergency Watershed Protection Program (7 CFR part 624);
(b) The U.S. Forest Service under its Burned-Area Emergency Rehabilitation Handbook
(FSH 2509.13);
(c) The Department of the Interior for wildland fire management burned area emergency
stabilization and rehabilitation (DOI Manual part 620, Ch. 3);
(d) The Office of Surface Mining, or states with approved programs, for abandoned mine
land reclamation activities under Title IV of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act
(30 CFR Subchapter R), where the activity does not involve coal extraction; or
(e) The Farm Service Agency under its Emergency Conservation Program (7 CFR part
701).
In general, the prospective permittee should wait until the district engineer issues an
NWP verification or 45 calendar days have passed before proceeding with the watershed
A5-22
21
protection and rehabilitation activity. However, in cases where there is an unacceptable hazard to
life or a significant loss of property or economic hardship will occur, the emergency watershed
protection and rehabilitation activity may proceed immediately and the district engineer will
consider the information in the pre-construction notification and any comments received as a
result of agency coordination to decide whether the NWP 37 authorization should be modified,
suspended, or revoked in accordance with the procedures at 33 CFR 330.5.
Notification: Except in cases where there is an unacceptable hazard to life or a significant
loss of property or economic hardship will occur, the permittee must submit a pre-construction
notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity (see general condition 31).
(Sections 10 and 404)
38. Cleanup of Hazardous and Toxic Waste. Specific activities required to effect the
containment, stabilization, or removal of hazardous or toxic waste materials that are performed,
ordered, or sponsored by a government agency with established legal or regulatory authority.
Court ordered remedial action plans or related settlements are also authorized by this NWP. This
NWP does not authorize the establishment of new disposal sites or the expansion of existing sites
used for the disposal of hazardous or toxic waste.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity. (See general condition 31.) (Sections 10 and 404)
Note: Activities undertaken entirely on a Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) site by authority of CERCLA as approved or
required by EPA, are not required to obtain permits under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act or
Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act.
39. Commercial and Institutional Developments. Discharges of dredged or fill material
into non-tidal waters of the United States for the construction or expansion of commercial and
institutional building foundations and building pads and attendant features that are necessary for
the use and maintenance of the structures. Attendant features may include, but are not limited to,
roads, parking lots, garages, yards, utility lines, storm water management facilities, and
recreation facilities such as playgrounds and playing fields. Examples of commercial
developments include retail stores, industrial facilities, restaurants, business parks, and shopping
centers. Examples of institutional developments include schools, fire stations, government office
buildings, judicial buildings, public works buildings, libraries, hospitals, and places of worship.
The construction of new golf courses and new ski areas is not authorized by this NWP.
The discharge must not cause the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of non-tidal waters of the
United States, including the loss of no more than 300 linear feet of stream bed, unless for
intermittent and ephemeral stream beds the district engineer waives the 300 linear foot limit by
making a written determination concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse
effects. This NWP does not authorize discharges into non-tidal wetlands adjacent to tidal waters.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity. (See general condition 31.) (Sections 10 and 404)
Note: For any activity that involves the construction of a wind energy generating
structure, solar tower, or overhead transmission line, a copy of the PCN and NWP verification
will be provided to the Department of Defense Siting Clearinghouse, which will evaluate
potential effects on military activities.
A5-23
22
40. Agricultural Activities. Discharges of dredged or fill material into non-tidal waters of
the United States for agricultural activities, including the construction of building pads for farm
buildings. Authorized activities include the installation, placement, or construction of drainage
tiles, ditches, or levees; mechanized land clearing; land leveling; the relocation of existing
serviceable drainage ditches constructed in waters of the United States; and similar activities.
This NWP also authorizes the construction of farm ponds in non-tidal waters of the
United States, excluding perennial streams, provided the farm pond is used solely for agricultural
purposes. This NWP does not authorize the construction of aquaculture ponds.
This NWP also authorizes discharges of dredged or fill material into non-tidal waters of
the United States to relocate existing serviceable drainage ditches constructed in non-tidal
streams.
The discharge must not cause the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of non-tidal waters of the
United States, including the loss of no more than 300 linear feet of stream bed, unless for
intermittent and ephemeral stream beds the district engineer waives the 300 linear foot limit by
making a written determination concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse
effects. This NWP does not authorize discharges into non-tidal wetlands adjacent to tidal waters.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity. (See general condition 31.) (Section 404)
Note: Some discharges for agricultural activities may qualify for an exemption under
Section 404(f) of the Clean Water Act (see 33 CFR 323.4). This NWP authorizes the
construction of farm ponds that do not qualify for the Clean Water Act Section 404(f)(1)(C)
exemption because of the recapture provision at Section 404(f)(2).
41. Reshaping Existing Drainage Ditches. Discharges of dredged or fill material into nontidal waters of the United States, excluding non-tidal wetlands adjacent to tidal waters, to modify
the cross-sectional configuration of currently serviceable drainage ditches constructed in waters
of the United States, for the purpose of improving water quality by regrading the drainage ditch
with gentler slopes, which can reduce erosion, increase growth of vegetation, and increase uptake
of nutrients and other substances by vegetation. The reshaping of the ditch cannot increase
drainage capacity beyond the original as-built capacity nor can it expand the area drained by the
ditch as originally constructed (i.e., the capacity of the ditch must be the same as originally
constructed and it cannot drain additional wetlands or other waters of the United States).
Compensatory mitigation is not required because the work is designed to improve water quality.
This NWP does not authorize the relocation of drainage ditches constructed in waters of
the United States; the location of the centerline of the reshaped drainage ditch must be
approximately the same as the location of the centerline of the original drainage ditch. This NWP
does not authorize stream channelization or stream relocation projects.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity, if more than 500 linear feet of drainage ditch will be
reshaped. (See general condition 31.) (Section 404)
42. Recreational Facilities. Discharges of dredged or fill material into non-tidal waters of
the United States for the construction or expansion of recreational facilities. Examples of
recreational facilities that may be authorized by this NWP include playing fields (e.g., football
fields, baseball fields), basketball courts, tennis courts, hiking trails, bike paths, golf courses, ski
areas, horse paths, nature centers, and campgrounds (excluding recreational vehicle parks). This
A5-24
23
NWP also authorizes the construction or expansion of small support facilities, such as
maintenance and storage buildings and stables that are directly related to the recreational activity,
but it does not authorize the construction of hotels, restaurants, racetracks, stadiums, arenas, or
similar facilities.
The discharge must not cause the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of non-tidal waters of the
United States, including the loss of no more than 300 linear feet of stream bed, unless for
intermittent and ephemeral stream beds the district engineer waives the 300 linear foot limit by
making a written determination concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse
effects. This NWP does not authorize discharges into non-tidal wetlands adjacent to tidal waters.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity. (See general condition 31.) (Section 404)
43. Stormwater Management Facilities. Discharges of dredged or fill material into nontidal waters of the United States for the construction of stormwater management facilities,
including stormwater detention basins and retention basins and other stormwater management
facilities; the construction of water control structures, outfall structures and emergency
spillways; and the construction of low impact development integrated management features such
as bioretention facilities (e.g., rain gardens), vegetated filter strips, grassed swales, and
infiltration trenches. This NWP also authorizes, to the extent that a section 404 permit is
required, discharges of dredged or fill material into non-tidal waters of the United States for the
maintenance of stormwater management facilities. Note that stormwater management facilities
that are determined to be waste treatment systems under 33 CFR 328.3(a)(8) are not waters of
the United States, and maintenance of these waste treatment systems generally does not require a
section 404 permit.
The discharge must not cause the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of non-tidal waters of the
United States, including the loss of no more than 300 linear feet of stream bed, unless for
intermittent and ephemeral stream beds the district engineer waives the 300 linear foot limit by
making a written determination concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse
effects. This NWP does not authorize discharges into non-tidal wetlands adjacent to tidal waters.
This NWP does not authorize discharges of dredged or fill material for the construction of new
stormwater management facilities in perennial streams.
Notification: For the construction of new stormwater management facilities, or the
expansion of existing stormwater management facilities, the permittee must submit a preconstruction notification to the district engineer prior to commencing the activity. (See general
condition 31.) Maintenance activities do not require pre-construction notification if they are
limited to restoring the original design capacities of the stormwater management facility.
(Section 404)
44. Mining Activities. Discharges of dredged or fill material into non-tidal waters of the
United States for mining activities, except for coal mining activities. The discharge must not
cause the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of non-tidal waters of the United States, including the loss
of no more than 300 linear feet of stream bed, unless for intermittent and ephemeral stream beds
the district engineer waives the 300 linear foot limit by making a written determination
concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse effects. This NWP does not
authorize discharges into non-tidal wetlands adjacent to tidal waters.
A5-25
24
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity. (See general condition 31.) If reclamation is required
by other statutes, then a copy of the reclamation plan must be submitted with the preconstruction notification. (Sections 10 and 404)
45. Repair of Uplands Damaged by Discrete Events. This NWP authorizes discharges of
dredged or fill material, including dredging or excavation, into all waters of the United States for
activities associated with the restoration of upland areas damaged by storms, floods, or other
discrete events. This NWP authorizes bank stabilization to protect the restored uplands. The
restoration of the damaged areas, including any bank stabilization, must not exceed the contours,
or ordinary high water mark, that existed before the damage occurred. The district engineer
retains the right to determine the extent of the pre-existing conditions and the extent of any
restoration work authorized by this NWP. The work must commence, or be under contract to
commence, within two years of the date of damage, unless this condition is waived in writing by
the district engineer. This NWP cannot be used to reclaim lands lost to normal erosion processes
over an extended period.
This NWP does not authorize beach restoration or nourishment.
Minor dredging is limited to the amount necessary to restore the damaged upland area
and should not significantly alter the pre-existing bottom contours of the waterbody.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer (see general condition 31) within 12-months of the date of the damage. The preconstruction notification should include documentation, such as a recent topographic survey or
photographs, to justify the extent of the proposed restoration. (Sections 10 and 404)
Note: The uplands themselves that are lost as a result of a storm, flood, or other discrete
event can be replaced without a section 404 permit, if the uplands are restored to the ordinary
high water mark (in non-tidal waters) or high tide line (in tidal waters). (See also 33 CFR 328.5.)
This NWP authorizes discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States
associated with the restoration of uplands.
46. Discharges in Ditches. Discharges of dredged or fill material into non-tidal ditches
that are: (1) constructed in uplands, (2) receive water from an area determined to be a water of
the United States prior to the construction of the ditch, (3) divert water to an area determined to
be a water of the United States prior to the construction of the ditch, and (4) are determined to be
waters of the United States. The discharge must not cause the loss of greater than one acre of
waters of the United States.
This NWP does not authorize discharges of dredged or fill material into ditches
constructed in streams or other waters of the United States, or in streams that have been relocated
in uplands. This NWP does not authorize discharges of dredged or fill material that increase the
capacity of the ditch and drain those areas determined to be waters of the United States prior to
construction of the ditch.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity. (See general condition 31.) (Section 404)
47. [Reserved]
A5-26

48. Commercial Shellfish Aquaculture Activities. Discharges of dredged or fill material
in waters of the United States or structures or work in navigable waters of the United States
necessary for commercial shellfish aquaculture operations in authorized project areas. For the
purposes of this NWP, the project area is the area in which the operator is currently authorized to
conduct commercial shellfish aquaculture activities, as identified through a lease or permit issued
by an appropriate state or local government agency, a treaty, or any other easement, lease, deed,
or contract which establishes an enforceable property interest for the operator. This NWP
authorizes the installation of buoys, floats, racks, trays, nets, lines, tubes, containers, and other
structures into navigable waters of the United States. This NWP also authorizes discharges of
dredged or fill material into waters of the United States necessary for shellfish seeding, rearing,
cultivating, transplanting, and harvesting activities. Rafts and other floating structures must be
securely anchored and clearly marked. This NWP does not authorize:
(a) The cultivation of a nonindigenous species unless that species has been previously
cultivated in the waterbody;
(b) The cultivation of an aquatic nuisance species as defined in the Nonindigenous
Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990; or,
(c) Attendant features such as docks, piers, boat ramps, stockpiles, or staging areas, or
the deposition of shell material back into waters of the United States as waste.
This NWP also authorizes commercial shellfish aquaculture activities in new project
areas, provided the project proponent has obtained a valid authorization, such as a lease or permit
issued by an appropriate state or local government agency, and those activities do not directly
affect more than 1/2-acre of submerged aquatic vegetation beds.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer if: (1) dredge harvesting, tilling, or harrowing is conducted in areas inhabited by
submerged aquatic vegetation; (2) the activity will include a species not previously cultivated in
the waterbody; (3) the activity involves a change from bottom culture to floating or suspended
culture; or (4) the activity occurs in a new project area. (See general condition 31.)
In addition to the information required by paragraph (b) of general condition 31, the preconstruction notification must also include the following information: (1) a map showing the
boundaries of the project area, with latitude and longitude coordinates for each corner of the
project area; (2) the name(s) of the cultivated species; and (3) whether canopy predator nets are
being used. (Sections 10 and 404)
Note 1: The permittee should notify the applicable U.S. Coast Guard office regarding the
project.
Note 2: To prevent introduction of aquatic nuisance species, no material that has been
taken from a different waterbody may be reused in the current project area, unless it has been
treated in accordance with the applicable regional aquatic nuisance species management plan.
Note 3: The Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990
defines “aquatic nuisance species” as “a nonindigenous species that threatens the diversity or
abundance of native species or the ecological stability of infested waters, or commercial,
agricultural, aquacultural, or recreational activities dependent on such waters.”
49. Coal Remining Activities. Discharges of dredged or fill material into non-tidal waters
of the United States associated with the remining and reclamation of lands that were previously
mined for coal. The activities must already be authorized, or they must currently be in process as
part of an integrated permit processing procedure, by the Department of Interior Office of
A5-27
26
Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, or by states with approved programs under Title
IV or Title V of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) of 1977. Areas
previously mined include reclaimed mine sites, abandoned mine land areas, or lands under bond
forfeiture contracts.
As part of the project, the permittee may conduct new coal mining activities in
conjunction with the remining activities when he or she clearly demonstrates to the district
engineer that the overall mining plan will result in a net increase in aquatic resource functions.
The Corps will consider the SMCRA agency’s decision regarding the amount of currently
undisturbed adjacent lands needed to facilitate the remining and reclamation of the previously
mined area. The total area disturbed by new mining must not exceed 40 percent of the total
acreage covered by both the remined area and the additional area necessary to carry out the
reclamation of the previously mined area.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification and a document
describing how the overall mining plan will result in a net increase in aquatic resource functions
to the district engineer and receive written authorization prior to commencing the activity. (See
general condition 31.) (Sections 10 and 404)
50. Underground Coal Mining Activities. Discharges of dredged or fill material into nontidal waters of the United States associated with underground coal mining and reclamation
operations provided the activities are authorized, or are currently being processed as part of an
integrated permit processing procedure, by the Department of Interior, Office of Surface Mining
Reclamation and Enforcement, or by states with approved programs under Title V of the Surface
Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
The discharge must not cause the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of non-tidal waters of the
United States, including the loss of no more than 300 linear feet of stream bed, unless for
intermittent and ephemeral stream beds the district engineer waives the 300 linear foot limit by
making a written determination concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse
effects. This NWP does not authorize discharges into non-tidal wetlands adjacent to tidal waters.
This NWP does not authorize coal preparation and processing activities outside of the mine site.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer and receive written authorization prior to commencing the activity. (See general
condition 31.) If reclamation is required by other statutes, then a copy of the reclamation plan
must be submitted with the pre-construction notification. (Sections 10 and 404)
Note: Coal preparation and processing activities outside of the mine site may be
authorized by NWP 21.
51. Land-Based Renewable Energy Generation Facilities. Discharges of dredged or fill
material into non-tidal waters of the United States for the construction, expansion, or
modification of land-based renewable energy production facilities, including attendant features.
Such facilities include infrastructure to collect solar (concentrating solar power and
photovoltaic), wind, biomass, or geothermal energy. Attendant features may include, but are not
limited to roads, parking lots, and stormwater management facilities within the land-based
renewable energy generation facility.
The discharge must not cause the loss of greater than1/2-acre of non-tidal waters of the
United States, including the loss of no more than 300 linear feet of stream bed, unless for
intermittent and ephemeral stream beds the district engineer waives the 300 linear foot limit by
A5-28
27
making a written determination concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse
effects. This permit does not authorize discharges into non-tidal wetlands adjacent to tidal
waters.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity. (See general condition 31.) (Sections 10 and 404)
Note 1: Utility lines constructed to transfer the energy from the land-based renewable
generation facility to a distribution system, regional grid, or other facility are generally
considered to be linear projects and each separate and distant crossing of a waterbody is eligible
for treatment as a separate single and complete linear project. Those utility lines may be
authorized by NWP 12 or another Department of the Army authorization. If the only activities
associated with the construction, expansion, or modification of a land-based renewable energy
generation facility that require Department of the Army authorization are discharges of dredged
or fill material into waters of the United States to construct, maintain, repair, and/or remove
utility lines, then NWP 12 shall be used if those activities meet the terms and conditions of NWP
12, including any applicable regional conditions and any case-specific conditions imposed by the
district engineer.
Note 2: For any activity that involves the construction of a wind energy generating
structure, solar tower, or overhead transmission line, a copy of the PCN and NWP verification
will be provided to the Department of Defense Siting Clearinghouse, which will evaluate
potential effects on military activities.
52. Water-Based Renewable Energy Generation Pilot Projects. Structures and work in
navigable waters of the United States and discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the
United States for the construction, expansion, modification, or removal of water-based wind or
hydrokinetic renewable energy generation pilot projects and their attendant features. Attendant
features may include, but are not limited to, land-based collection and distribution facilities,
control facilities, roads, parking lots, and stormwater management facilities.
For the purposes of this NWP, the term “pilot project” means an experimental project
where the renewable energy generation units will be monitored to collect information on their
performance and environmental effects at the project site.
The discharge must not cause the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of waters of the United
States, including the loss of no more than 300 linear feet of stream bed, unless for intermittent
and ephemeral stream beds the district engineer waives the 300 linear foot limit by making a
written determination concluding that the discharge will result in minimal adverse effects. The
placement of a transmission line on the bed of a navigable water of the United States from the
renewable energy generation unit(s) to a land-based collection and distribution facility is
considered a structure under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (see 33 CFR
322.2(b)), and the placement of the transmission line on the bed of a navigable water of the
United States is not a loss of waters of the United States for the purposes of applying the 1/2-acre
or 300 linear foot limits.
For each single and complete project, no more than 10 generation units (e.g., wind
turbines or hydrokinetic devices) are authorized.
This NWP does not authorize activities in coral reefs. Structures in an anchorage area
established by the U.S. Coast Guard must comply with the requirements in 33 CFR part
322.5(l)(2). Structures may not be placed in established danger zones or restricted areas as
designated in 33 CFR part 334, Federal navigation channels, shipping safety fairways or traffic
A5-29
28
separation schemes established by the U.S. Coast Guard (see 33 CFR part 322.5(l)(1)), or EPA
or Corps designated open water dredged material disposal areas.
Upon completion of the pilot project, the generation units, transmission lines, and other
structures or fills associated with the pilot project must be removed to the maximum extent
practicable unless they are authorized by a separate Department of the Army authorization, such
as another NWP, an individual permit, or a regional general permit. Completion of the pilot
project will be identified as the date of expiration of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) license, or the expiration date of the NWP authorization if no FERC license is issued.
Notification: The permittee must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer prior to commencing the activity. (See general condition 31.) (Sections 10 and 404)
Note 1: Utility lines constructed to transfer the energy from the land-based collection
facility to a distribution system, regional grid, or other facility are generally considered to be
linear projects and each separate and distant crossing of a waterbody is eligible for treatment as a
separate single and complete linear project. Those utility lines may be authorized by NWP 12 or
another Department of the Army authorization.
Note 2: An activity that is located on an existing locally or federally maintained U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers project requires separate approval from the Chief of Engineers under
33 U.S.C. 408.
Note 3: If the pilot project, including any transmission lines, is placed in navigable waters
of the United States (i.e., section 10 waters) within the coastal United States, the Great Lakes,
and United States territories, copies of the pre-construction notification and NWP verification
will be sent by the Corps to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National
Ocean Service, for charting the generation units and associated transmission line(s) to protect
navigation.
Note 4: For any activity that involves the construction of a wind energy generating
structure, solar tower, or overhead transmission line, a copy of the PCN and NWP verification
will be provided to the Department of Defense Siting Clearinghouse, which will evaluate
potential effects on military activities.
C. Nationwide Permit General Conditions
Note: To qualify for NWP authorization, the prospective permittee must comply with the
following general conditions, as applicable, in addition to any regional or case-specific
conditions imposed by the division engineer or district engineer. Prospective permittees should
contact the appropriate Corps district office to determine if regional conditions have been
imposed on an NWP. Prospective permittees should also contact the appropriate Corps district
office to determine the status of Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality certification and/or
Coastal Zone Management Act consistency for an NWP. Every person who may wish to obtain
permit authorization under one or more NWPs, or who is currently relying on an existing or prior
permit authorization under one or more NWPs, has been and is on notice that all of the
provisions of 33 CFR §§ 330.1 through 330.6 apply to every NWP authorization. Note especially
33 CFR § 330.5 relating to the modification, suspension, or revocation of any NWP
authorization.
1. Navigation. (a) No activity may cause more than a minimal adverse effect on
navigation.
A5-30
29
(b) Any safety lights and signals prescribed by the U.S. Coast Guard, through regulations
or otherwise, must be installed and maintained at the permittee's expense on authorized facilities
in navigable waters of the United States.
(c) The permittee understands and agrees that, if future operations by the United States
require the removal, relocation, or other alteration, of the structure or work herein authorized, or
if, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Army or his authorized representative, said structure or
work shall cause unreasonable obstruction to the free navigation of the navigable waters, the
permittee will be required, upon due notice from the Corps of Engineers, to remove, relocate, or
alter the structural work or obstructions caused thereby, without expense to the United States. No
claim shall be made against the United States on account of any such removal or alteration.
2. Aquatic Life Movements. No activity may substantially disrupt the necessary life cycle
movements of those species of aquatic life indigenous to the waterbody, including those species
that normally migrate through the area, unless the activity's primary purpose is to impound
water. All permanent and temporary crossings of waterbodies shall be suitably culverted,
bridged, or otherwise designed and constructed to maintain low flows to sustain the movement of
those aquatic species.
3. Spawning Areas. Activities in spawning areas during spawning seasons must be
avoided to the maximum extent practicable. Activities that result in the physical destruction (e.g.,
through excavation, fill, or downstream smothering by substantial turbidity) of an important
spawning area are not authorized.
4. Migratory Bird Breeding Areas. Activities in waters of the United States that serve as
breeding areas for migratory birds must be avoided to the maximum extent practicable.
5. Shellfish Beds. No activity may occur in areas of concentrated shellfish populations,
unless the activity is directly related to a shellfish harvesting activity authorized by NWPs 4 and
48, or is a shellfish seeding or habitat restoration activity authorized by NWP 27.
6. Suitable Material. No activity may use unsuitable material (e.g., trash, debris, car
bodies, asphalt, etc.). Material used for construction or discharged must be free from toxic
pollutants in toxic amounts (see Section 307 of the Clean Water Act).
7. Water Supply Intakes. No activity may occur in the proximity of a public water supply
intake, except where the activity is for the repair or improvement of public water supply intake
structures or adjacent bank stabilization.
8. Adverse Effects From Impoundments. If the activity creates an impoundment of water,
adverse effects to the aquatic system due to accelerating the passage of water, and/or restricting
its flow must be minimized to the maximum extent practicable.
9. Management of Water Flows. To the maximum extent practicable, the pre-construction
course, condition, capacity, and location of open waters must be maintained for each activity,
including stream channelization and storm water management activities, except as provided
below. The activity must be constructed to withstand expected high flows. The activity must not
A5-31
30
restrict or impede the passage of normal or high flows, unless the primary purpose of the activity
is to impound water or manage high flows. The activity may alter the pre-construction course,
condition, capacity, and location of open waters if it benefits the aquatic environment (e.g.,
stream restoration or relocation activities).
10. Fills Within 100-Year Floodplains. The activity must comply with applicable FEMAapproved state or local floodplain management requirements.
11. Equipment. Heavy equipment working in wetlands or mudflats must be placed on
mats, or other measures must be taken to minimize soil disturbance.
12. Soil Erosion and Sediment Controls. Appropriate soil erosion and sediment controls
must be used and maintained in effective operating condition during construction, and all
exposed soil and other fills, as well as any work below the ordinary high water mark or high tide
line, must be permanently stabilized at the earliest practicable date. Permittees are encouraged to
perform work within waters of the United States during periods of low-flow or no-flow.
13. Removal of Temporary Fills. Temporary fills must be removed in their entirety and
the affected areas returned to pre-construction elevations. The affected areas must be
revegetated, as appropriate.
14. Proper Maintenance. Any authorized structure or fill shall be properly maintained,
including maintenance to ensure public safety and compliance with applicable NWP general
conditions, as well as any activity-specific conditions added by the district engineer to an NWP
authorization.
15. Single and Complete Project. The activity must be a single and complete project. The
same NWP cannot be used more than once for the same single and complete project.
16. Wild and Scenic Rivers. No activity may occur in a component of the National Wild
and Scenic River System, or in a river officially designated by Congress as a “study river” for
possible inclusion in the system while the river is in an official study status, unless the
appropriate Federal agency with direct management responsibility for such river, has determined
in writing that the proposed activity will not adversely affect the Wild and Scenic River
designation or study status. Information on Wild and Scenic Rivers may be obtained from the
appropriate Federal land management agency responsible for the designated Wild and Scenic
River or study river (e.g., National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land
Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service).
17. Tribal Rights. No activity or its operation may impair reserved tribal rights, including,
but not limited to, reserved water rights and treaty fishing and hunting rights.
18. Endangered Species. (a) No activity is authorized under any NWP which is likely to
directly or indirectly jeopardize the continued existence of a threatened or endangered species or
a species proposed for such designation, as identified under the Federal Endangered Species Act
(ESA), or which will directly or indirectly destroy or adversely modify the critical habitat of such
A5-32
31
species. No activity is authorized under any NWP which “may affect” a listed species or critical
habitat, unless Section 7 consultation addressing the effects of the proposed activity has been
completed.
(b) Federal agencies should follow their own procedures for complying with the
requirements of the ESA. Federal permittees must provide the district engineer with the
appropriate documentation to demonstrate compliance with those requirements. The district
engineer will review the documentation and determine whether it is sufficient to address ESA
compliance for the NWP activity, or whether additional ESA consultation is necessary.
(c) Non-federal permittees must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer if any listed species or designated critical habitat might be affected or is in the vicinity
of the project, or if the project is located in designated critical habitat, and shall not begin work
on the activity until notified by the district engineer that the requirements of the ESA have been
satisfied and that the activity is authorized. For activities that might affect Federally-listed
endangered or threatened species or designated critical habitat, the pre-construction notification
must include the name(s) of the endangered or threatened species that might be affected by the
proposed work or that utilize the designated critical habitat that might be affected by the
proposed work. The district engineer will determine whether the proposed activity “may affect”
or will have “no effect” to listed species and designated critical habitat and will notify the nonFederal applicant of the Corps’ determination within 45 days of receipt of a complete preconstruction notification. In cases where the non-Federal applicant has identified listed species or
critical habitat that might be affected or is in the vicinity of the project, and has so notified the
Corps, the applicant shall not begin work until the Corps has provided notification the proposed
activities will have “no effect” on listed species or critical habitat, or until Section 7 consultation
has been completed. If the non-Federal applicant has not heard back from the Corps within 45
days, the applicant must still wait for notification from the Corps.
(d) As a result of formal or informal consultation with the FWS or NMFS the district
engineer may add species-specific regional endangered species conditions to the NWPs.
(e) Authorization of an activity by a NWP does not authorize the “take” of a threatened or
endangered species as defined under the ESA. In the absence of separate authorization (e.g., an
ESA Section 10 Permit, a Biological Opinion with “incidental take” provisions, etc.) from the
U.S. FWS or the NMFS, The Endangered Species Act prohibits any person subject to the
jurisdiction of the United States to take a listed species, where "take" means to harass, harm,
pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such
conduct. The word “harm” in the definition of “take'' means an act which actually kills or injures
wildlife. Such an act may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it
actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns,
including breeding, feeding or sheltering.
(f) Information on the location of threatened and endangered species and their critical
habitat can be obtained directly from the offices of the U.S. FWS and NMFS or their world wide
web pages at http://www.fws.gov/ or http://www.fws.gov/ipac and
http://www.noaa.gov/fisheries.html respectively.
19. Migratory Birds and Bald and Golden Eagles. The permittee is responsible for
obtaining any “take” permits required under the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s regulations
governing compliance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or the Bald and Golden Eagle
A5-33
32
Protection Act. The permittee should contact the appropriate local office of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service to determine if such “take” permits are required for a particular activity.
20. Historic Properties. (a) In cases where the district engineer determines that the
activity may affect properties listed, or eligible for listing, in the National Register of Historic
Places, the activity is not authorized, until the requirements of Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) have been satisfied.
(b) Federal permittees should follow their own procedures for complying with the
requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Federal permittees must
provide the district engineer with the appropriate documentation to demonstrate compliance with
those requirements. The district engineer will review the documentation and determine whether
it is sufficient to address section 106 compliance for the NWP activity, or whether additional
section 106 consultation is necessary.
(c) Non-federal permittees must submit a pre-construction notification to the district
engineer if the authorized activity may have the potential to cause effects to any historic
properties listed on, determined to be eligible for listing on, or potentially eligible for listing on
the National Register of Historic Places, including previously unidentified properties. For such
activities, the pre-construction notification must state which historic properties may be affected
by the proposed work or include a vicinity map indicating the location of the historic properties
or the potential for the presence of historic properties. Assistance regarding information on the
location of or potential for the presence of historic resources can be sought from the State
Historic Preservation Officer or Tribal Historic Preservation Officer, as appropriate, and the
National Register of Historic Places (see 33 CFR 330.4(g)). When reviewing pre-construction
notifications, district engineers will comply with the current procedures for addressing the
requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The district engineer shall
make a reasonable and good faith effort to carry out appropriate identification efforts, which may
include background research, consultation, oral history interviews, sample field investigation,
and field survey. Based on the information submitted and these efforts, the district engineer shall
determine whether the proposed activity has the potential to cause an effect on the historic
properties. Where the non-Federal applicant has identified historic properties on which the
activity may have the potential to cause effects and so notified the Corps, the non-Federal
applicant shall not begin the activity until notified by the district engineer either that the activity
has no potential to cause effects or that consultation under Section 106 of the NHPA has been
completed.
(d) The district engineer will notify the prospective permittee within 45 days of receipt
of a complete pre-construction notification whether NHPA Section 106 consultation is required.
Section 106 consultation is not required when the Corps determines that the activity does not
have the potential to cause effects on historic properties (see 36 CFR §800.3(a)). If NHPA
section 106 consultation is required and will occur, the district engineer will notify the nonFederal applicant that he or she cannot begin work until Section 106 consultation is completed. If
the non-Federal applicant has not heard back from the Corps within 45 days, the applicant must
still wait for notification from the Corps.
(e) Prospective permittees should be aware that section 110k of the NHPA (16 U.S.C.
470h-2(k)) prevents the Corps from granting a permit or other assistance to an applicant who,
with intent to avoid the requirements of Section 106 of the NHPA, has intentionally significantly
adversely affected a historic property to which the permit would relate, or having legal power to
A5-34
33
prevent it, allowed such significant adverse effect to occur, unless the Corps, after consultation
with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), determines that circumstances
justify granting such assistance despite the adverse effect created or permitted by the applicant.
If circumstances justify granting the assistance, the Corps is required to notify the ACHP and
provide documentation specifying the circumstances, the degree of damage to the integrity of
any historic properties affected, and proposed mitigation. This documentation must include any
views obtained from the applicant, SHPO/THPO, appropriate Indian tribes if the undertaking
occurs on or affects historic properties on tribal lands or affects properties of interest to those
tribes, and other parties known to have a legitimate interest in the impacts to the permitted
activity on historic properties.
21. Discovery of Previously Unknown Remains and Artifacts. If you discover any
previously unknown historic, cultural or archeological remains and artifacts while accomplishing
the activity authorized by this permit, you must immediately notify the district engineer of what
you have found, and to the maximum extent practicable, avoid construction activities that may
affect the remains and artifacts until the required coordination has been completed. The district
engineer will initiate the Federal, Tribal and state coordination required to determine if the items
or remains warrant a recovery effort or if the site is eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places.
22. Designated Critical Resource Waters. Critical resource waters include, NOAAmanaged marine sanctuaries and marine monuments, and National Estuarine Research Reserves.
The district engineer may designate, after notice and opportunity for public comment, additional
waters officially designated by a state as having particular environmental or ecological
significance, such as outstanding national resource waters or state natural heritage sites. The
district engineer may also designate additional critical resource waters after notice and
opportunity for public comment.
(a) Discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States are not
authorized by NWPs 7, 12, 14, 16, 17, 21, 29, 31, 35, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 49, 50, 51, and 52 for
any activity within, or directly affecting, critical resource waters, including wetlands adjacent to
such waters.
(b) For NWPs 3, 8, 10, 13, 15, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 30, 33, 34, 36, 37, and 38,
notification is required in accordance with general condition 31, for any activity proposed in the
designated critical resource waters including wetlands adjacent to those waters. The district
engineer may authorize activities under these NWPs only after it is determined that the impacts
to the critical resource waters will be no more than minimal.
23. Mitigation. The district engineer will consider the following factors when
determining appropriate and practicable mitigation necessary to ensure that adverse effects on
the aquatic environment are minimal:
(a) The activity must be designed and constructed to avoid and minimize adverse effects,
both temporary and permanent, to waters of the United States to the maximum extent practicable
at the project site (i.e., on site).
(b) Mitigation in all its forms (avoiding, minimizing, rectifying, reducing, or
compensating for resource losses) will be required to the extent necessary to ensure that the
adverse effects to the aquatic environment are minimal.
A5-35
34
(c) Compensatory mitigation at a minimum one-for-one ratio will be required for all
wetland losses that exceed 1/10-acre and require pre-construction notification, unless the district
engineer determines in writing that either some other form of mitigation would be more
environmentally appropriate or the adverse effects of the proposed activity are minimal, and
provides a project-specific waiver of this requirement. For wetland losses of 1/10-acre or less
that require pre-construction notification, the district engineer may determine on a case-by-case
basis that compensatory mitigation is required to ensure that the activity results in minimal
adverse effects on the aquatic environment. Compensatory mitigation projects provided to offset
losses of aquatic resources must comply with the applicable provisions of 33 CFR part 332.
(1) The prospective permittee is responsible for proposing an appropriate compensatory
mitigation option if compensatory mitigation is necessary to ensure that the activity results in
minimal adverse effects on the aquatic environment.
(2) Since the likelihood of success is greater and the impacts to potentially valuable
uplands are reduced, wetland restoration should be the first compensatory mitigation option
considered.
(3) If permittee-responsible mitigation is the proposed option, the prospective permittee is
responsible for submitting a mitigation plan. A conceptual or detailed mitigation plan may be
used by the district engineer to make the decision on the NWP verification request, but a final
mitigation plan that addresses the applicable requirements of 33 CFR 332.4(c)(2) – (14) must be
approved by the district engineer before the permittee begins work in waters of the United States,
unless the district engineer determines that prior approval of the final mitigation plan is not
practicable or not necessary to ensure timely completion of the required compensatory mitigation
(see 33 CFR 332.3(k)(3)).
(4) If mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program credits are the proposed option, the
mitigation plan only needs to address the baseline conditions at the impact site and the number of
credits to be provided.
(5) Compensatory mitigation requirements (e.g., resource type and amount to be provided
as compensatory mitigation, site protection, ecological performance standards, monitoring
requirements) may be addressed through conditions added to the NWP authorization, instead of
components of a compensatory mitigation plan.
(d) For losses of streams or other open waters that require pre-construction notification,
the district engineer may require compensatory mitigation, such as stream rehabilitation,
enhancement, or preservation, to ensure that the activity results in minimal adverse effects on the
aquatic environment.
(e) Compensatory mitigation will not be used to increase the acreage losses allowed by
the acreage limits of the NWPs. For example, if an NWP has an acreage limit of 1/2-acre, it
cannot be used to authorize any project resulting in the loss of greater than 1/2-acre of waters of
the United States, even if compensatory mitigation is provided that replaces or restores some of
the lost waters. However, compensatory mitigation can and should be used, as necessary, to
ensure that a project already meeting the established acreage limits also satisfies the minimal
impact requirement associated with the NWPs.
(f) Compensatory mitigation plans for projects in or near streams or other open waters
will normally include a requirement for the restoration or establishment, maintenance, and legal
protection (e.g., conservation easements) of riparian areas next to open waters. In some cases,
riparian areas may be the only compensatory mitigation required. Riparian areas should consist
of native species. The width of the required riparian area will address documented water quality
A5-36
35
or aquatic habitat loss concerns. Normally, the riparian area will be 25 to 50 feet wide on each
side of the stream, but the district engineer may require slightly wider riparian areas to address
documented water quality or habitat loss concerns. If it is not possible to establish a riparian area
on both sides of a stream, or if the waterbody is a lake or coastal waters, then restoring or
establishing a riparian area along a single bank or shoreline may be sufficient. Where both
wetlands and open waters exist on the project site, the district engineer will determine the
appropriate compensatory mitigation (e.g., riparian areas and/or wetlands compensation) based
on what is best for the aquatic environment on a watershed basis. In cases where riparian areas
are determined to be the most appropriate form of compensatory mitigation, the district engineer
may waive or reduce the requirement to provide wetland compensatory mitigation for wetland
losses.
(g) Permittees may propose the use of mitigation banks, in-lieu fee programs, or separate
permittee-responsible mitigation. For activities resulting in the loss of marine or estuarine
resources, permittee-responsible compensatory mitigation may be environmentally preferable if
there are no mitigation banks or in-lieu fee programs in the area that have marine or estuarine
credits available for sale or transfer to the permittee. For permittee-responsible mitigation, the
special conditions of the NWP verification must clearly indicate the party or parties responsible
for the implementation and performance of the compensatory mitigation project, and, if required,
its long-term management.
(h) Where certain functions and services of waters of the United States are permanently
adversely affected, such as the conversion of a forested or scrub-shrub wetland to a herbaceous
wetland in a permanently maintained utility line right-of-way, mitigation may be required to
reduce the adverse effects of the project to the minimal level.
24. Safety of Impoundment Structures. To ensure that all impoundment structures are
safely designed, the district engineer may require non-Federal applicants to demonstrate that the
structures comply with established state dam safety criteria or have been designed by qualified
persons. The district engineer may also require documentation that the design has been
independently reviewed by similarly qualified persons, and appropriate modifications made to
ensure safety.
25. Water Quality. Where States and authorized Tribes, or EPA where applicable, have
not previously certified compliance of an NWP with CWA Section 401, individual 401 Water
Quality Certification must be obtained or waived (see 33 CFR 330.4(c)). The district engineer or
State or Tribe may require additional water quality management measures to ensure that the
authorized activity does not result in more than minimal degradation of water quality.
26. Coastal Zone Management. In coastal states where an NWP has not previously
received a state coastal zone management consistency concurrence, an individual state coastal
zone management consistency concurrence must be obtained, or a presumption of concurrence
must occur (see 33 CFR 330.4(d)). The district engineer or a State may require additional
measures to ensure that the authorized activity is consistent with state coastal zone management
requirements.
27. Regional and Case-By-Case Conditions. The activity must comply with any regional
conditions that may have been added by the Division Engineer (see 33 CFR 330.4(e)) and with
A5-37
36
any case specific conditions added by the Corps or by the state, Indian Tribe, or U.S. EPA in its
section 401 Water Quality Certification, or by the state in its Coastal Zone Management Act
consistency determination.
28. Use of Multiple Nationwide Permits. The use of more than one NWP for a single and
complete project is prohibited, except when the acreage loss of waters of the United States
authorized by the NWPs does not exceed the acreage limit of the NWP with the highest specified
acreage limit. For example, if a road crossing over tidal waters is constructed under NWP 14,
with associated bank stabilization authorized by NWP 13, the maximum acreage loss of waters
of the United States for the total project cannot exceed 1/3-acre.
29. Transfer of Nationwide Permit Verifications. If the permittee sells the property
associated with a nationwide permit verification, the permittee may transfer the nationwide
permit verification to the new owner by submitting a letter to the appropriate Corps district office
to validate the transfer. A copy of the nationwide permit verification must be attached to the
letter, and the letter must contain the following statement and signature:
“When the structures or work authorized by this nationwide permit are still in existence at
the time the property is transferred, the terms and conditions of this nationwide permit, including
any special conditions, will continue to be binding on the new owner(s) of the property. To
validate the transfer of this nationwide permit and the associated liabilities associated with
compliance with its terms and conditions, have the transferee sign and date below.”
_____________________________________________
(Transferee)
_____________________________________________
(Date)
30. Compliance Certification. Each permittee who receives an NWP verification letter
from the Corps must provide a signed certification documenting completion of the authorized
activity and any required compensatory mitigation. The success of any required permitteeresponsible mitigation, including the achievement of ecological performance standards, will be
addressed separately by the district engineer. The Corps will provide the permittee the
certification document with the NWP verification letter. The certification document will
include:
(a) A statement that the authorized work was done in accordance with the NWP
authorization, including any general, regional, or activity-specific conditions;
(b) A statement that the implementation of any required compensatory mitigation was
completed in accordance with the permit conditions. If credits from a mitigation bank or in-lieu
fee program are used to satisfy the compensatory mitigation requirements, the certification must
include the documentation required by 33 CFR 332.3(l)(3) to confirm that the permittee secured
the appropriate number and resource type of credits; and
(c) The signature of the permittee certifying the completion of the work and mitigation.

31. Pre-Construction Notification. (a) Timing. Where required by the terms of the NWP,
the prospective permittee must notify the district engineer by submitting a pre-construction
notification (PCN) as early as possible. The district engineer must determine if the PCN is
complete within 30 calendar days of the date of receipt and, if the PCN is determined to be
incomplete, notify the prospective permittee within that 30 day period to request the additional
information necessary to make the PCN complete. The request must specify the information
needed to make the PCN complete. As a general rule, district engineers will request additional
information necessary to make the PCN complete only once. However, if the prospective
permittee does not provide all of the requested information, then the district engineer will notify
the prospective permittee that the PCN is still incomplete and the PCN review process will not
commence until all of the requested information has been received by the district engineer. The
prospective permittee shall not begin the activity until either:
(1) He or she is notified in writing by the district engineer that the activity may proceed
under the NWP with any special conditions imposed by the district or division engineer; or
(2) 45 calendar days have passed from the district engineer’s receipt of the complete PCN
and the prospective permittee has not received written notice from the district or division
engineer. However, if the permittee was required to notify the Corps pursuant to general
condition 18 that listed species or critical habitat might be affected or in the vicinity of the
project, or to notify the Corps pursuant to general condition 20 that the activity may have the
potential to cause effects to historic properties, the permittee cannot begin the activity until
receiving written notification from the Corps that there is “no effect” on listed species or “no
potential to cause effects” on historic properties, or that any consultation required under Section
7 of the Endangered Species Act (see 33 CFR 330.4(f)) and/or Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation (see 33 CFR 330.4(g)) has been completed. Also, work cannot begin under
NWPs 21, 49, or 50 until the permittee has received written approval from the Corps. If the
proposed activity requires a written waiver to exceed specified limits of an NWP, the permittee
may not begin the activity until the district engineer issues the waiver. If the district or division
engineer notifies the permittee in writing that an individual permit is required within 45 calendar
days of receipt of a complete PCN, the permittee cannot begin the activity until an individual
permit has been obtained. Subsequently, the permittee’s right to proceed under the NWP may be
modified, suspended, or revoked only in accordance with the procedure set forth in 33 CFR
330.5(d)(2).
(b) Contents of Pre-Construction Notification: The PCN must be in writing and include
the following information:
(1) Name, address and telephone numbers of the prospective permittee;
(2) Location of the proposed project;
(3) A description of the proposed project; the project’s purpose; direct and indirect
adverse environmental effects the project would cause, including the anticipated amount of loss
of water of the United States expected to result from the NWP activity, in acres, linear feet, or
other appropriate unit of measure; any other NWP(s), regional general permit(s), or individual
permit(s) used or intended to be used to authorize any part of the proposed project or any related
activity. The description should be sufficiently detailed to allow the district engineer to
determine that the adverse effects of the project will be minimal and to determine the need for
compensatory mitigation. Sketches should be provided when necessary to show that the activity
complies with the terms of the NWP. (Sketches usually clarify the project and when provided
results in a quicker decision. Sketches should contain sufficient detail to provide an illustrative
A5-39
38
description of the proposed activity (e.g., a conceptual plan), but do not need to be detailed
engineering plans);
(4) The PCN must include a delineation of wetlands, other special aquatic sites, and other
waters, such as lakes and ponds, and perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral streams, on the
project site. Wetland delineations must be prepared in accordance with the current method
required by the Corps. The permittee may ask the Corps to delineate the special aquatic sites and
other waters on the project site, but there may be a delay if the Corps does the delineation,
especially if the project site is large or contains many waters of the United States. Furthermore,
the 45 day period will not start until the delineation has been submitted to or completed by the
Corps, as appropriate;
(5) If the proposed activity will result in the loss of greater than 1/10-acre of wetlands and
a PCN is required, the prospective permittee must submit a statement describing how the
mitigation requirement will be satisfied, or explaining why the adverse effects are minimal and
why compensatory mitigation should not be required. As an alternative, the prospective
permittee may submit a conceptual or detailed mitigation plan.
(6) If any listed species or designated critical habitat might be affected or is in the vicinity
of the project, or if the project is located in designated critical habitat, for non-Federal applicants
the PCN must include the name(s) of those endangered or threatened species that might be
affected by the proposed work or utilize the designated critical habitat that may be affected by
the proposed work. Federal applicants must provide documentation demonstrating compliance
with the Endangered Species Act; and
(7) For an activity that may affect a historic property listed on, determined to be eligible
for listing on, or potentially eligible for listing on, the National Register of Historic Places, for
non-Federal applicants the PCN must state which historic property may be affected by the
proposed work or include a vicinity map indicating the location of the historic property. Federal
applicants must provide documentation demonstrating compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act.
(c) Form of Pre-Construction Notification: The standard individual permit application
form (Form ENG 4345) may be used, but the completed application form must clearly indicate
that it is a PCN and must include all of the information required in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7)
of this general condition. A letter containing the required information may also be used.
(d) Agency Coordination: (1) The district engineer will consider any comments from
Federal and state agencies concerning the proposed activity’s compliance with the terms and
conditions of the NWPs and the need for mitigation to reduce the project’s adverse
environmental effects to a minimal level.
(2) For all NWP activities that require pre-construction notification and result in the loss
of greater than 1/2-acre of waters of the United States, for NWP 21, 29, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 50,
51, and 52 activities that require pre-construction notification and will result in the loss of greater
than 300 linear feet of intermittent and ephemeral stream bed, and for all NWP 48 activities that
require pre-construction notification, the district engineer will immediately provide (e.g., via email, facsimile transmission, overnight mail, or other expeditious manner) a copy of the
complete PCN to the appropriate Federal or state offices (U.S. FWS, state natural resource or
water quality agency, EPA, State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) or Tribal Historic
Preservation Office (THPO), and, if appropriate, the NMFS). With the exception of NWP 37,
these agencies will have 10 calendar days from the date the material is transmitted to telephone
or fax the district engineer notice that they intend to provide substantive, site-specific comments.
A5-40
39
The comments must explain why the agency believes the adverse effects will be more than
minimal. If so contacted by an agency, the district engineer will wait an additional 15 calendar
days before making a decision on the pre-construction notification. The district engineer will
fully consider agency comments received within the specified time frame concerning the
proposed activity’s compliance with the terms and conditions of the NWPs, including the need
for mitigation to ensure the net adverse environmental effects to the aquatic environment of the
proposed activity are minimal. The district engineer will provide no response to the resource
agency, except as provided below. The district engineer will indicate in the administrative record
associated with each pre-construction notification that the resource agencies’ concerns were
considered. For NWP 37, the emergency watershed protection and rehabilitation activity may
proceed immediately in cases where there is an unacceptable hazard to life or a significant loss of
property or economic hardship will occur. The district engineer will consider any comments
received to decide whether the NWP 37 authorization should be modified, suspended, or revoked
in accordance with the procedures at 33 CFR 330.5.
(3) In cases of where the prospective permittee is not a Federal agency, the district
engineer will provide a response to NMFS within 30 calendar days of receipt of any Essential
Fish Habitat conservation recommendations, as required by Section 305(b)(4)(B) of the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.
(4) Applicants are encouraged to provide the Corps with either electronic files or multiple
copies of pre-construction notifications to expedite agency coordination.
D. District Engineer’s Decision
1. In reviewing the PCN for the proposed activity, the district engineer will determine
whether the activity authorized by the NWP will result in more than minimal individual or
cumulative adverse environmental effects or may be contrary to the public interest. For a linear
project, this determination will include an evaluation of the individual crossings to determine
whether they individually satisfy the terms and conditions of the NWP(s), as well as the
cumulative effects caused by all of the crossings authorized by NWP. If an applicant requests a
waiver of the 300 linear foot limit on impacts to intermittent or ephemeral streams or of an
otherwise applicable limit, as provided for in NWPs 13, 21, 29, 36, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 50, 51 or
52, the district engineer will only grant the waiver upon a written determination that the NWP
activity will result in minimal adverse effects. When making minimal effects determinations the
district engineer will consider the direct and indirect effects caused by the NWP activity. The
district engineer will also consider site specific factors, such as the environmental setting in the
vicinity of the NWP activity, the type of resource that will be affected by the NWP activity, the
functions provided by the aquatic resources that will be affected by the NWP activity, the degree
or magnitude to which the aquatic resources perform those functions, the extent that aquatic
resource functions will be lost as a result of the NWP activity (e.g., partial or complete loss), the
duration of the adverse effects (temporary or permanent), the importance of the aquatic resource
functions to the region (e.g., watershed or ecoregion), and mitigation required by the district
engineer. If an appropriate functional assessment method is available and practicable to use, that
assessment method may be used by the district engineer to assist in the minimal adverse effects
determination. The district engineer may add case-specific special conditions to the NWP
authorization to address site-specific environmental concerns.
A5-41
40
2. If the proposed activity requires a PCN and will result in a loss of greater than 1/10-
acre of wetlands, the prospective permittee should submit a mitigation proposal with the PCN.
Applicants may also propose compensatory mitigation for projects with smaller impacts. The
district engineer will consider any proposed compensatory mitigation the applicant has included
in the proposal in determining whether the net adverse environmental effects to the aquatic
environment of the proposed activity are minimal. The compensatory mitigation proposal may be
either conceptual or detailed. If the district engineer determines that the activity complies with
the terms and conditions of the NWP and that the adverse effects on the aquatic environment are
minimal, after considering mitigation, the district engineer will notify the permittee and include
any activity-specific conditions in the NWP verification the district engineer deems necessary.
Conditions for compensatory mitigation requirements must comply with the appropriate
provisions at 33 CFR 332.3(k). The district engineer must approve the final mitigation plan
before the permittee commences work in waters of the United States, unless the district engineer
determines that prior approval of the final mitigation plan is not practicable or not necessary to
ensure timely completion of the required compensatory mitigation. If the prospective permittee
elects to submit a compensatory mitigation plan with the PCN, the district engineer will
expeditiously review the proposed compensatory mitigation plan. The district engineer must
review the proposed compensatory mitigation plan within 45 calendar days of receiving a
complete PCN and determine whether the proposed mitigation would ensure no more than
minimal adverse effects on the aquatic environment. If the net adverse effects of the project on
the aquatic environment (after consideration of the compensatory mitigation proposal) are
determined by the district engineer to be minimal, the district engineer will provide a timely
written response to the applicant. The response will state that the project can proceed under the
terms and conditions of the NWP, including any activity-specific conditions added to the NWP
authorization by the district engineer.
3. If the district engineer determines that the adverse effects of the proposed work are
more than minimal, then the district engineer will notify the applicant either: (a) that the project
does not qualify for authorization under the NWP and instruct the applicant on the procedures to
seek authorization under an individual permit; (b) that the project is authorized under the NWP
subject to the applicant’s submission of a mitigation plan that would reduce the adverse effects
on the aquatic environment to the minimal level; or (c) that the project is authorized under the
NWP with specific modifications or conditions. Where the district engineer determines that
mitigation is required to ensure no more than minimal adverse effects occur to the aquatic
environment, the activity will be authorized within the 45-day PCN period, with activity-specific
conditions that state the mitigation requirements. The authorization will include the necessary
conceptual or detailed mitigation or a requirement that the applicant submit a mitigation plan that
would reduce the adverse effects on the aquatic environment to the minimal level. When
mitigation is required, no work in waters of the United States may occur until the district
engineer has approved a specific mitigation plan or has determined that prior approval of a final
mitigation plan is not practicable or not necessary to ensure timely completion of the required
compensatory mitigation.

A5-42
41
E. Further Information
1. District Engineers have authority to determine if an activity complies with the terms
and conditions of an NWP.
2. NWPs do not obviate the need to obtain other federal, state, or local permits,
approvals, or authorizations required by law.
3. NWPs do not grant any property rights or exclusive privileges.
4. NWPs do not authorize any injury to the property or rights of others.
5. NWPs do not authorize interference with any existing or proposed Federal project.
F. Definitions
Best management practices (BMPs): Policies, practices, procedures, or structures
implemented to mitigate the adverse environmental effects on surface water quality resulting
from development. BMPs are categorized as structural or non-structural.
Compensatory mitigation: The restoration (re-establishment or rehabilitation),
establishment (creation), enhancement, and/or in certain circumstances preservation of aquatic
resources for the purposes of offsetting unavoidable adverse impacts which remain after all
appropriate and practicable avoidance and minimization has been achieved.
Currently serviceable: Useable as is or with some maintenance, but not so degraded as to
essentially require reconstruction.
Direct effects: Effects that are caused by the activity and occur at the same time and
place.
Discharge: The term “discharge” means any discharge of dredged or fill material.
Enhancement: The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of
an aquatic resource to heighten, intensify, or improve a specific aquatic resource function(s).
Enhancement results in the gain of selected aquatic resource function(s), but may also lead to a
decline in other aquatic resource function(s). Enhancement does not result in a gain in aquatic
resource area.
Ephemeral stream: An ephemeral stream has flowing water only during, and for a short
duration after, precipitation events in a typical year. Ephemeral stream beds are located above the
water table year-round. Groundwater is not a source of water for the stream. Runoff from rainfall
is the primary source of water for stream flow.
Establishment (creation): The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological
characteristics present to develop an aquatic resource that did not previously exist at an upland
site. Establishment results in a gain in aquatic resource area.
High Tide Line: The line of intersection of the land with the water’s surface at the
maximum height reached by a rising tide. The high tide line may be determined, in the absence
of actual data, by a line of oil or scum along shore objects, a more or less continuous deposit of
fine shell or debris on the foreshore or berm, other physical markings or characteristics,
vegetation lines, tidal gages, or other suitable means that delineate the general height reached by
a rising tide. The line encompasses spring high tides and other high tides that occur with periodic
frequency but does not include storm surges in which there is a departure from the normal or
predicted reach of the tide due to the piling up of water against a coast by strong winds such as
those accompanying a hurricane or other intense storm.
A5-43
42
Historic Property: Any prehistoric or historic district, site (including archaeological site),
building, structure, or other object included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register
of Historic Places maintained by the Secretary of the Interior. This term includes artifacts,
records, and remains that are related to and located within such properties. The term includes
properties of traditional religious and cultural importance to an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian
organization and that meet the National Register criteria (36 CFR part 60).
Independent utility: A test to determine what constitutes a single and complete non-linear
project in the Corps regulatory program. A project is considered to have independent utility if it
would be constructed absent the construction of other projects in the project area. Portions of a
multi-phase project that depend upon other phases of the project do not have independent utility.
Phases of a project that would be constructed even if the other phases were not built can be
considered as separate single and complete projects with independent utility.
Indirect effects: Effects that are caused by the activity and are later in time or farther
removed in distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable.
Intermittent stream: An intermittent stream has flowing water during certain times of the
year, when groundwater provides water for stream flow. During dry periods, intermittent streams
may not have flowing water. Runoff from rainfall is a supplemental source of water for stream
flow.
Loss of waters of the United States: Waters of the United States that are permanently
adversely affected by filling, flooding, excavation, or drainage because of the regulated activity.
Permanent adverse effects include permanent discharges of dredged or fill material that change
an aquatic area to dry land, increase the bottom elevation of a waterbody, or change the use of a
waterbody. The acreage of loss of waters of the United States is a threshold measurement of the
impact to jurisdictional waters for determining whether a project may qualify for an NWP; it is
not a net threshold that is calculated after considering compensatory mitigation that may be used
to offset losses of aquatic functions and services. The loss of stream bed includes the linear feet
of stream bed that is filled or excavated. Waters of the United States temporarily filled, flooded,
excavated, or drained, but restored to pre-construction contours and elevations after construction,
are not included in the measurement of loss of waters of the United States. Impacts resulting
from activities eligible for exemptions under Section 404(f) of the Clean Water Act are not
considered when calculating the loss of waters of the United States.
Non-tidal wetland: A non-tidal wetland is a wetland that is not subject to the ebb and
flow of tidal waters. The definition of a wetland can be found at 33 CFR 328.3(b). Non-tidal
wetlands contiguous to tidal waters are located landward of the high tide line (i.e., spring high
tide line).
Open water: For purposes of the NWPs, an open water is any area that in a year with
normal patterns of precipitation has water flowing or standing above ground to the extent that an
ordinary high water mark can be determined. Aquatic vegetation within the area of standing or
flowing water is either non-emergent, sparse, or absent. Vegetated shallows are considered to be
open waters. Examples of “open waters” include rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds.
Ordinary High Water Mark: An ordinary high water mark is a line on the shore
established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics, or by other
appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas (see 33 CFR
328.3(e)).
Perennial stream: A perennial stream has flowing water year-round during a typical year.
The water table is located above the stream bed for most of the year. Groundwater is the primary
A5-44
43
source of water for stream flow. Runoff from rainfall is a supplemental source of water for
stream flow.
Practicable: Available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost,
existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purposes.
Pre-construction notification: A request submitted by the project proponent to the Corps
for confirmation that a particular activity is authorized by nationwide permit. The request may be
a permit application, letter, or similar document that includes information about the proposed
work and its anticipated environmental effects. Pre-construction notification may be required by
the terms and conditions of a nationwide permit, or by regional conditions. A pre-construction
notification may be voluntarily submitted in cases where pre-construction notification is not
required and the project proponent wants confirmation that the activity is authorized by
nationwide permit.
Preservation: The removal of a threat to, or preventing the decline of, aquatic resources
by an action in or near those aquatic resources. This term includes activities commonly
associated with the protection and maintenance of aquatic resources through the implementation
of appropriate legal and physical mechanisms. Preservation does not result in a gain of aquatic
resource area or functions.
Re-establishment: The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological
characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural/historic functions to a former aquatic
resource. Re-establishment results in rebuilding a former aquatic resource and results in a gain in
aquatic resource area and functions.
Rehabilitation: The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics
of a site with the goal of repairing natural/historic functions to a degraded aquatic resource.
Rehabilitation results in a gain in aquatic resource function, but does not result in a gain in
aquatic resource area.
Restoration: The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a
site with the goal of returning natural/historic functions to a former or degraded aquatic resource.
For the purpose of tracking net gains in aquatic resource area, restoration is divided into two
categories: re-establishment and rehabilitation.
Riffle and pool complex: Riffle and pool complexes are special aquatic sites under the
404(b)(1) Guidelines. Riffle and pool complexes sometimes characterize steep gradient sections
of streams. Such stream sections are recognizable by their hydraulic characteristics. The rapid
movement of water over a course substrate in riffles results in a rough flow, a turbulent surface,
and high dissolved oxygen levels in the water. Pools are deeper areas associated with riffles. A
slower stream velocity, a streaming flow, a smooth surface, and a finer substrate characterize
pools.
Riparian areas: Riparian areas are lands adjacent to streams, lakes, and estuarine-marine
shorelines. Riparian areas are transitional between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, through
which surface and subsurface hydrology connects riverine, lacustrine, estuarine, and marine
waters with their adjacent wetlands, non-wetland waters, or uplands. Riparian areas provide a
variety of ecological functions and services and help improve or maintain local water quality.
(See general condition 23.)
Shellfish seeding: The placement of shellfish seed and/or suitable substrate to increase
shellfish production. Shellfish seed consists of immature individual shellfish or individual
shellfish attached to shells or shell fragments (i.e., spat on shell). Suitable substrate may consist
A5-45
44
of shellfish shells, shell fragments, or other appropriate materials placed into waters for shellfish
habitat.
Single and complete linear project: A linear project is a project constructed for the
purpose of getting people, goods, or services from a point of origin to a terminal point, which
often involves multiple crossings of one or more waterbodies at separate and distant locations.
The term “single and complete project” is defined as that portion of the total linear project
proposed or accomplished by one owner/developer or partnership or other association of
owners/developers that includes all crossings of a single water of the United States (i.e., a single
waterbody) at a specific location. For linear projects crossing a single or multiple waterbodies
several times at separate and distant locations, each crossing is considered a single and complete
project for purposes of NWP authorization. However, individual channels in a braided stream or
river, or individual arms of a large, irregularly shaped wetland or lake, etc., are not separate
waterbodies, and crossings of such features cannot be considered separately.
Single and complete non-linear project: For non-linear projects, the term “single and
complete project” is defined at 33 CFR 330.2(i) as the total project proposed or accomplished by
one owner/developer or partnership or other association of owners/developers. A single and
complete non-linear project must have independent utility (see definition of “independent
utility”). Single and complete non-linear projects may not be “piecemealed” to avoid the limits
in an NWP authorization.
Stormwater management: Stormwater management is the mechanism for controlling
stormwater runoff for the purposes of reducing downstream erosion, water quality degradation,
and flooding and mitigating the adverse effects of changes in land use on the aquatic
environment.
Stormwater management facilities: Stormwater management facilities are those facilities,
including but not limited to, stormwater retention and detention ponds and best management
practices, which retain water for a period of time to control runoff and/or improve the quality
(i.e., by reducing the concentration of nutrients, sediments, hazardous substances and other
pollutants) of stormwater runoff.
Stream bed: The substrate of the stream channel between the ordinary high water marks.
The substrate may be bedrock or inorganic particles that range in size from clay to boulders.
Wetlands contiguous to the stream bed, but outside of the ordinary high water marks, are not
considered part of the stream bed.
Stream channelization: The manipulation of a stream’s course, condition, capacity, or
location that causes more than minimal interruption of normal stream processes. A channelized
stream remains a water of the United States.
Structure: An object that is arranged in a definite pattern of organization. Examples of
structures include, without limitation, any pier, boat dock, boat ramp, wharf, dolphin, weir,
boom, breakwater, bulkhead, revetment, riprap, jetty, artificial island, artificial reef, permanent
mooring structure, power transmission line, permanently moored floating vessel, piling, aid to
navigation, or any other manmade obstacle or obstruction.
Tidal wetland: A tidal wetland is a wetland (i.e., water of the United States) that is
inundated by tidal waters. The definitions of a wetland and tidal waters can be found at 33 CFR
328.3(b) and 33 CFR 328.3(f), respectively. Tidal waters rise and fall in a predictable and
measurable rhythm or cycle due to the gravitational pulls of the moon and sun. Tidal waters end
where the rise and fall of the water surface can no longer be practically measured in a predictable
A5-46
45
rhythm due to masking by other waters, wind, or other effects. Tidal wetlands are located
channelward of the high tide line, which is defined at 33 CFR 328.3(d).
Vegetated shallows: Vegetated shallows are special aquatic sites under the 404(b)(1)
Guidelines. They are areas that are permanently inundated and under normal circumstances have
rooted aquatic vegetation, such as seagrasses in marine and estuarine systems and a variety of
vascular rooted plants in freshwater systems.
Waterbody: For purposes of the NWPs, a waterbody is a jurisdictional water of the
United States. If a jurisdictional wetland is adjacent – meaning bordering, contiguous, or
neighboring – to a waterbody determined to be a water of the United States under 33 CFR
328.3(a)(1)-(6), that waterbody and its adjacent wetlands are considered together as a single
aquatic unit (see 33 CFR 328.4(c)(2)). Examples of “waterbodies” include streams, rivers, lakes,
ponds, and wetlands.

NWP.
A5-48
2
4. Bank Stabilization. Any project including new or maintenance bank stabilization activities
requires pre-construction notification to the District Engineer in accordance with Nationwide
Permit General Condition 31 for Pre-Construction Notification. This requirement does not apply
to maintenance work exempt by 33 CFR 323.4 (a)(2). Each notification must also include the
following information:
a. Need for the work, including the cause of the erosion and the threat posed to structures,
infrastructure, and/or public safety. The notification must also include a justification for the need
to place fill or structures waterward of the line of the Corps’ jurisdiction (typically, the ordinary
high water mark or mean higher high water mark).
 b. Current and expected post-project sediment movement and deposition patterns in and
near the project area. In tidal waters, describe the location and size of the nearest bluff sediment
sources (feeder bluffs) to the project area and current and expected post-project nearshore drift
patterns in the project area.
 c. Current and expected post-project habitat conditions, including the presence of fish,
wildlife and plant species, submerged aquatic vegetation, spawning habitat, and special aquatic
sites (e.g., vegetated shallows, riffle and pool complexes, or mudflats) in the project area.
d. In rivers and streams, an assessment of the likely impact of the proposed work on
upstream, downstream and cross-stream properties (at a minimum the area assessed should
extend from the nearest upstream bend to the nearest downstream bend of the watercourse).
Discuss the methodology used for determining effects. The Corps reserves the right to request
an increase in the reach assessment area to fully address the relevant ecological reach and
associated habitat.
e. For new bank stabilization activities in rivers and streams, describe the type and length
of existing bank stabilization within 300 feet up and downstream of the project area. In tidal
areas, describe the type and length of existing bank stabilization within 300 feet along the
shoreline on both sides of the project area.
 f. Demonstrate the proposed project incorporates the least environmentally damaging
practicable bank protection methods. These methods include, but are not limited to, the use of
bioengineering, biotechnical design, root wads, large woody material, native plantings, and
beach nourishment in certain circumstances. If rock must be used due to site erosion conditions,
explain how the bank stabilization structure incorporates elements beneficial to fish. If the Corps
determines you have not incorporated the least environmentally damaging practicable bank
protection methods and/or have not fully compensated for impacts to aquatic resources, you must
submit a compensatory mitigation plan to compensate for impacts to aquatic resources.
g. A planting plan using native riparian plant species unless the applicant demonstrates a
planting plan is not appropriate or not practicable.
5. Crossings of Waters of the United States. Any project including installing, replacing, or
modifying crossings of waters of the United States, such as culverts, requires pre-construction
notification to the District Engineer in accordance with Nationwide Permit General Condition 31
A5-49
3
for Pre-Construction Notification. This requirement does not apply to maintenance work exempt
by 33 CFR 323.4 (a)(2). Each notification must also include the following information:
 a. Need for the crossing.
 b. Crossing design criteria and design methodology.
c. Rationale behind using the specific design method for the crossing.
6. Cultural Resources and Human Burials. Permittees must immediately stop work and
notify the District Engineer within 24 hours if, during the course of conducting authorized work,
human burials, cultural resources, or historic properties, as identified by the National Historic
Preservation Act, are discovered. Failure to stop work in the area of discovery until the Corps
can comply with the provisions of 33 CFR 325 Appendix C, the National Historic Preservation
Act, and other pertinent laws and regulations could result in a violation of state and federal laws.
Violators are subject to civil and criminal penalties.
7. Essential Fish Habitat. An activity which may adversely affect essential fish habitat, as
identified under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), may
not be authorized by NWP until essential fish habitat requirements have been met by the
applicant and the Corps. Non-federal permittees shall notify the District Engineer if essential
fish habitat may be affected by, or is in the vicinity of, a proposed activity and shall not begin
work until notified by the District Engineer that the requirements of the essential fish habitat
provisions of the MSA have been satisfied and the activity is authorized. The notification must
identify the type(s) of essential fish habitat (e.g., Pacific salmon, groundfish, and/or coastalpelagic species) managed by a Fishery Management Plan that may be affected. Information
about essential fish habitat is available at http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/.

8. Vegetation Protection and Restoration. Permittees must clearly mark all construction area
boundaries before beginning work. The removal of native vegetation in riparian areas and
wetlands, and the removal of submerged aquatic vegetation in estuarine and tidal areas must be
avoided and minimized to the maximum extent practicable. Areas subject to temporary
vegetation removal shall be replanted with appropriate native species by the end of the first
planting season following the disturbance except as waived by the District Engineer. If an
aquaculture area is permitted to impact submerged aquatic vegetation under NWP 48, the
aquaculture area does not need to be replanted with submerged aquatic vegetation.
9. Access. You must allow representatives of this office to inspect the authorized activity at any
time deemed necessary to ensure the work is being, or has been, accomplished in accordance
with the terms and conditions of your permit.
10. Contractor Notification of Permit Requirements. The permittee must provide a copy of
the nationwide permit verification letter, conditions, and permit drawings to all contractors
involved with the authorized work, prior to the commencement of any work in waters of the U.S.

Dear Garrett Dorsey:
The Department of Ecology (Ecology) has received the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ (Corps)
memorandum dated July 7, 2022, providing a functional analogy to Nationwide Permit (NWP) #
31 and 33 for the above project.
Upon review of functional analogy, Ecology has determined that the project meets the
requirements of the Nationwide permits and Ecology’s Programmatic Section 401 Water Quality
Certification for NWP # 31 and 33. Therefore, an Individual Section 401 certification will not be
required for this project and the Corps may proceed with the project.
Any changes to your project that would impact water quality should be submitted in writing to
Ecology before work begins for additional review.
This letter does not exempt you from other requirements of federal, state, and local agencies.
Please contact me if you have any questions regarding this letter at (360) 995-3252 or e-mail

Mount St. Helens
Toutle River SRS Spillway Crest Raise
Subject: RCC Spillway Crest Structure Foundation Condition
Geologic Mapping: David H. Scofield, P.E., P.E.G.
Date: 15Oct2012
Purpose: The purpose of this memorandum is to document the foundation conditions exposed
and prepared for the RCC spillway structure. The spillway structure is designed to be raised in
increments as conditions warrant up to 30 feet in height.
River Diversion: The Contractor diverted the low late-summer flow through the southern half of the
spillway approach channel. The northern portion of the spillway was protected by temporary dikes on
the upstream and southern (river) side. Once the northern portion of the structure which includes the
low flow channel and stilling basin was constructed, the Contractor diverted the river to the north and
over the new spillway crest. The Contractor then completed the southern portion of the structure.
Original Foundation Excavation: Originally, the rock removed from the spillway was blasted and
excavated to the designed grade lines. Because it was not a foundation for concrete structures, no
special precautions were taken. The rock was blasted and excavated in mass. Hence, the top of rock /
grade line was highly broken/fragmented from blast damage and excavation. Photographs of the
upstream edge of the stilling basin cut shows the typical mantling of loosened/fragment rock overlying
irregular contact of more intact rock.
Photo 1 and 2. Upstream edge of the stilling basin excavation. Photo shows the mantling of loosen and
fragmented rock mantling more intact bedrock. Stilling basin foundation is fragmented rock.
Foundation Excavation, Clean Up, and Preparation: Since, original construction, the sediments have
covered the approach channel and built up to the spillway crest. The Contractor excavated this
sediment down to the original grade lines/bedrock with conventional equipment. Grade lines for the
dam raised were adopted from the 1986 spillway design drawings. The actual top of rock line was at or
slightly below the design grade lines. Foundation rock exposed was highly broken up and fragmented
most likely from the original construction with varying amount of sediments deposited into the voids.
Excavation further mixed the sediments and rock fragments exposed. Because of the original heavy

blast damage, there was little true intact in-place rock exposed at the designed foundation grade. The
Contractor was directed to stop excavating at the designed grade line and not to continue to excavate to
intact rock below. The fragment rock condition was not anticipated, structural stability was rechecked
to verify that the exposed foundation conditions was adequate for the planned full 30-foot raise.
Photo 3. Final foundation of the northern half of the spillway crest. Spillway crest is on the right
portion, stilling basin in the center and the low flow channel on the left.
The mixed sediment and fragmented rock condition caused difficulties in foundation clean up.
Mechanical equipment just continued to loosen more rock deeper and mix the sediments in. The
eventual solution was to let the expose foundation dry out as much as possible and then clean the
foundation with sweeper on a Bobcat and high air pressure stream (Photograph 4). The goal was to
clean the foundation to at least where 50 percent of the exposed surface area would be rock fragments
with the remaining surface exposed as sand and silt sediments.
Photo 4. Sweeper on a Bob Cat used to
clean final foundation.
A7-2 FIO
The foundation was cleaned as best could and was judged to be adequate for the intended structure.
Foundation ranged from intact massive flow breccias to highly fractured basalt, fragmented rock with
less than 50 percent sediment, and fragmented rock with more than 50 percent sediment. All
foundations were firm to walk and drive heavy equipment over. Photographs of typical levels of
cleaning are shown.

Rock
Example of Intact Basalt Platey Basalt. Even intact bedrock still has some loosened fragments and
sediments.
Photographs 5 through 7. Typical levels of cleaning foundation.
Foundation Mapping: Field mapping was conducted on 23Sep2012 for the northern half and 8Oct2012
for the southern half. The foundation was prepared and mapped in two stages. Previous mapping of
the approach channel in 1986 did not different the exposed rock. Geologic mapping, generally
differentiated the areas of intact basalt rock, areas of flow breccias, and areas of fragmented rock. All
contacts are gradational, so contacts should only be considered approximate. Field mapping was done
A7-3 FIO
by waling over the surface and measuring with a cloth tape. Final compiled geologic map is shown in
Figure 1. The most notable feature in the foundation was a dewatering trench from drainage operation
that was left in place at station 0+195 167’LT. This trench was about 7 feet wide by 3 feet deep. It was
backfilled with broken rock. The location of this trench was measured from the first foundation drain
coming up out of the stilling basin.
Foundation Drains: Original design intended foundation drains to be drilled 5 feet into the underlying
bedrock on 10 foot spacing beneath the RCC structure. Because of the highly broken nature of the
foundation, there was concern that seepage may be greater than anticipated. To address seepage
concerns, foundation drains were drilled on foot spacing. The northern foundation drains were
observed with pool up to the new spillway crest. No water was observed coming out of the above water
drain holes. This suggests that through seepage beneath the structure is low enough that the fragment
rock foundation provides a natural drainage blanket.
Foundation drains flowing water in bend of structure at the south end.
Foundation Backwards Erosion Beneath Structure: A concern was identified that backward erosion of
the broken rock could initiate at the stilling basin where the RCC cover is the thinnest. To forestall this
possibility, the optional over excavation and constructing an 8 foot thick RCC layer at the upstream side
of the stilling basin was executed.

A7-4 FIO
Future Problems: No future problems are anticipated. It should be noted that higher drainage flow may
be observed in one or two foundation drains located where the drainage ditch was backfilled with rock
and left in place beneath the foundation. This will not expected to cause an internal erosion problem
because of the large rock size and low hydraulic gradient.
Future Considerations: Although, the foundation is not ideal, it is adequate for the designed structure.
For future consideration, the foundation beneath the spillway raise should be considered a mixture of
sediments and fragmented rock or a “pit-run rock”. If the spillway is ever raised above the planned 30
feet, new geotechnical investigation will have to be done. For future stability analysis, a continuous
upstream-downstream layer of mixed soil/fragmented rock should be considered.

MSH SRS Crest Raise (W9127N22R0021)
A9 Volume calculations
Volume analysis for cut and fill
Jeremy Totten CADD technician performed a contrast of TINs for the project to estimate volume of cut
and fill
Tin 1 – Existing conditions surface derived from 2014 Bathymetric lidar.  This gets a surface that
penetrates to the “secci” depth in water, however turbid water or turbulent water prevents returns so,
the surface should be higher than actual in places. (TRD1.104_3DVOL‐SURF.dwg, C‐TINN‐VIEW‐EXTG)
Tin 2 – design surface for the excavation of the plunge pool
(TRD1.104_3DVOL‐SURF.dwg, C‐TINN‐VIEW‐EXCV)
Tin 3 – Prepared surface = Tin 1 – Tin 2 = cut volume. (TRD1.104_3DVOL‐SURF.dwg, C‐TINN‐VIEW‐PREP)
Tin 4 ‐ design surface for the top of fill (RCC) (TRD1.104_3DVOL‐SURF.dwg, C‐TINN‐VIEW‐RCC)
RCC Volume = Tin 4 – Tin 3
JT generated a cut/fill report using AutoCAD on the BCOES BACKCHECK version of the TIN 4 model.

A check on the volume computations was made by Joel Kinunen using Arc Info.  The original data used
to generate Tin 1 was contrasted with Tin 2 with the following result.

Subject: RE: MSH SRS ‐ Volume Check
I talked to Mr. T yesterday and things look good.  I gave him this info and will be getting him more based
on the rest of the data soon.  His CAD excavation DXF had many very skinny triangles in it and that
seemed to bog down my system with no success.  After failing at different techniques I simplified the
shape it and got it to work in GIS.   
I was able to get something to compare to my 2014 LiDAR DEM, but I had to simplify your polygons by
merging all the skinny angles into fewer large triangles.  Looks like it kept all the elevations and general
shape well in GIS though.
If you want a better image than this, let me know what you would change.  I’ll work on incorporating the
excavation surface into my 2014 LiDAR elevation model.

Conclusion, Joel’s volume of cut estimate was 2,134 – 2,131 = 3 yards delta from JT.  Note the
excavation can be as deep as 9‐feet.
********************************************************************************
Joel prepared a similar estimate on volume using Arc Info
Note the volume is 33,141 cy and very similar to JT.  Note the fill depth can be as high as 18 feet.

MSH SRS Crest Raise (W9127N22R0021)
A9 Volume calculations
The question of accuracy came up while comparing as‐built surface from the first raise with the 2018
existing conditions bathymetric lidar.  JT used AutoCAD to compare the surfaces, described below;
The blue is Tin 4 Design Surface for 2nd raise, red is the merged 2012‐2014 data from Joel (1 foot
contours), while gray is from TRD1.101_CONT‐WA2011SF (As‐built first raise).  Delta is due to
measurement error, and modelling method
Given analysis of full 2nd raise foot‐print, the 2014 bathy lidar contrast 1st raise built (2012) shows
3,300CY of fill and 580 cut.  Height deltas vary from ‐7.5 to +6.5.  This represents an estimate of the fill
material and error associated with bathy lidar.  Thus, using the 2014 bathy lidar to compute the volume
of RCC placed may be an under estimate by around 10%.  If existing conditions were surveyed today
changes in fill volume will still exists given the intervening 8‐years of flow, erosion and sedimentation.  
USACE did not use the as‐built data to document existing conditions in the second raise contract
because we did not fully trust the survey work completed and we chose a shift in horizontal datum from
NAD27 to NAD83.  These facts reinforced our decision to require the Contractor perform surveys for
quantity take off and specifications were provided.

Foreword
This Standing Safety Procedure (SAF), Hazardous Energy Control (HEC) Program, is supplemental to, and
is authorized by ER 385-1-31, The Control of Hazardous Energy. ER 385-1-31 is the overall governing
document for USACE HEC programs and it mandates that Districts will supplement its contents with
specific procedures. This SAF is not intended to be the all-encompassing single source document for the
HEC Program. This document strives to capture those processes which have been identified to establish
consistent procedures and criteria for the safe and reliable control of hazardous energy at Portland District
operated facilities. Instances not specifically identified in this document may very well require additional
research into those documents identified in paragraph 3.0 of this document and possibly other industry
standard publications to include manufacturer maintenance guidance.

review with all APs signing onto the clearance, the limits of the de-energized and
isolated working area, including any unusual conditions.
11.5.6.4.1 At a minimum, a review of the Safe Clearance will take place at
the job site with the PAI and AP(s) and shall include: review of AHA,
work to be completed, inspection of the work site for hazardous energy,
and a review of the isolation point status.
11.5.6.4.2 Each Affected Person working under the group clearance shall
sign the Safe Clearance Sign in Sheet verifying he or she fully understands
the details of their job, the energy isolation devices actuated, the locks and
tags installed, and will then place their personal lock on the group lockbox.
 11.5.6.4.3 No AP shall sign into the clearance without concurring that the
isolation is adequate for their work.
 11.5.6.5 After reviewing the Safe Clearance, the PAI and the first AP signing onto the

19.8 After the Safe Clearance is issued, the PAI and the first AP signing onto the clearance shall inspect
and test the work site to verify the adequacy of the protection provided. The first AP shall concur
with the method of inspection and be qualified to perform the testing.
19.8.1 The method of testing shall be described on the specific AHA for the associated clearance.
Only the first AP to sign onto the clearance is required to test for the absence of hazardous
energy with the PAI. The AP and PAI who perform the verification/testing shall sign and
record this on the Safe Clearance Order.
19.8.2 The PAI and/or AP, by signing either the Safe Clearance Order form or Safe Clearance
Activity Log confirming the absence of hazardous energy, are acknowledging that
verification/testing has been performed as described in the AHA or Activity Log and no
hazardous energy was detected as of the date and time of their signature
19.8.3 The method of testing for isolation points added after the clearance is accepted, or re-hung

19.8.4 No other APs shall sign onto the Safe Clearance sign-in sheet prior to confirming the
completion of the verification/testing documentation.
19.8.5 Other APs are required to confirm the verification/testing has been completed by
observation of the AP’s signature on the Safe Clearance order. If isolation points have been
temp lifted and restored, confirmation of the testing signature is recorded on the Safe
Clearance Activity sheet.
 19.8.6 APs other than the first APs to sign onto the clearance may test the isolation provided it
poses no risk to APs already working at the job site protected by the clearance. For
example, testing for voltage with a voltmeter doesn’t add additional risk to AP’s already
working on the circuit. Attempting to open a spill gate while other APs are working below
it does increase the risk of danger to APs working below the spill gate.
